# Walkthrough 00: Real-World Active Directory Pentesting - The Complete Corporate Reality

**Purpose:** Understanding how actual corporate pentesting engagements work from the moment a client contacts you to the final report delivery  
**Author:** Written for people who want to become professional pentesters, not just hackers who run tools  
**Reality Check:** This is the unfiltered truth about what happens in corporate security consulting

## Introduction: Why This Walkthrough Exists

Before we talk about attacking Active Directory in our Napellam Bank lab, we need to understand the reality of corporate pentesting. Most tutorials teach you how to run BloodHound and Mimikatz. That's important, but it's only 20% of the job. The other 80% is understanding the business side - how companies hire pentesters, what legal documents protect you, how you get network access, what you're actually allowed to do, and how you communicate with clients who don't understand technical jargon.

This walkthrough will teach you things that certifications like OSCP and CEH don't cover. You won't learn this in YouTube videos or CTF competitions. This is knowledge you typically gain after working in corporate security for 2-3 years, making mistakes, and learning from senior consultants. I'm giving you this knowledge upfront so you don't walk into your first client engagement completely blind.

We'll use real examples throughout. When I say "real examples," I mean actual scenarios that happen in Indian IT companies - TCS, Infosys, Wipro, HCL, Tech Mahindra, and others. I'll also cover banking sector security (HDFC, ICICI, SBI) because that's where a lot of pentesting work happens due to regulatory requirements. Everything you read here reflects how pentesting actually works in the real corporate world, not the idealized version you see in movies or hacking forums.

## Part 1: How Companies Actually Find and Hire Penetration Testers

### Section 1.1: Understanding Compliance-Driven Pentesting

Let me start with the most common reason companies hire pentesters: compliance. But first, we need to understand what "compliance" actually means because this word gets thrown around a lot without proper explanation.

#### What is Compliance?

Compliance, in the simplest terms, means following rules. But not just any rules - these are legally mandated rules set by government regulators, industry bodies, or international standards organizations. When a company operates in a regulated industry like banking, healthcare, or telecommunications, they must prove they follow certain security standards. If they don't, they face massive fines, lose their operating licenses, or get shut down entirely.

Think of it like this: When you drive a car, you must follow traffic rules. You need a valid license, insurance, the car must pass pollution checks, and you must follow speed limits. If police catch you violating these, you get fined. Compliance in IT works the same way. Companies must follow certain "traffic rules" for how they handle data, protect systems, and manage security. Regulators act like police, conducting audits and issuing fines for violations.

Now, why does this matter for pentesting? Because many compliance frameworks specifically require regular security testing. It's not optional. The regulation literally says: "You must conduct penetration testing at least once per year" or "You must perform vulnerability assessments quarterly." This creates a massive demand for pentesting services because companies have no choice - they must hire pentesters or face legal consequences.

#### RBI Compliance - Banking Sector Deep Dive

Let's take a detailed example: Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and banking security. This is one of the biggest drivers of pentesting work in India, so understanding this thoroughly is crucial.

**What is RBI?**

RBI (Reserve Bank of India) is India's central bank. They regulate all banks operating in India - government banks like State Bank of India (SBI), private banks like HDFC and ICICI, foreign banks like Citibank and HSBC, and even payment banks and small finance banks. RBI has the power to issue licenses to banks, suspend their operations, or levy huge fines. When RBI says "jump," banks ask "how high?"

**Why does RBI care about IT security?**

Banks handle money - lots of it. A typical large bank in India holds deposits worth several lakh crores of rupees. If that bank's IT systems get hacked, catastrophic things can happen. Money can be stolen digitally, customer data can be leaked (violating privacy laws), or the banking system can be disrupted causing national economic impact. RBI's job is to prevent this.

In the past decade, there have been multiple cases where Indian banks got hacked. For example, in 2018, Cosmos Bank in Pune lost ₹94 crores in a cyber attack. Attackers compromised the bank's ATM server infrastructure and withdrew money from ATMs across the world simultaneously. RBI investigated this incident and realized many banks had weak cybersecurity practices. This led RBI to create strict cybersecurity guidelines.

**RBI's Cybersecurity Framework for Banks**

In 2016, RBI issued detailed cybersecurity guidelines for all banks. These guidelines are not suggestions - they're mandatory requirements. Banks must implement specific security controls and prove compliance through regular audits and testing. Let me break down what RBI actually requires:

**Requirement 1: Information Security Policy**

Every bank must have a formal, written information security policy approved by their Board of Directors. This policy must cover how they protect customer data, manage employee access, secure their network, and respond to security incidents. The policy must be reviewed annually and updated based on emerging threats. RBI auditors actually read these policies during inspections. If a bank doesn't have a clear, comprehensive policy, RBI can take enforcement action.

**Requirement 2: IT Steering Committee**

Banks must create a special committee at the CEO/Board level called the IT Steering Committee (IT-SC). This committee meets quarterly to review cybersecurity posture, approve major IT changes, and ensure adequate budget for security. The idea is that security shouldn't be just the IT department's responsibility - it should be a board-level concern. Senior management must be directly involved and accountable.

**Requirement 3: Cyber Crisis Management Plan**

RBI requires banks to have a detailed plan for handling cyber attacks. This plan must specify who gets alerted when an attack happens, what steps to take within the first hour, how to preserve evidence for forensics, when to inform RBI (within 6 hours for major incidents), and how to communicate with customers. Banks must test this plan through simulation exercises at least twice a year. RBI sometimes conducts surprise drills where they simulate an attack scenario and observe how the bank responds.

**Requirement 4: Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT)**

This is where we come in as pentesters. RBI mandates that all banks must conduct:

**Annual comprehensive penetration testing:** This means testing the entire IT infrastructure - internet-facing systems, internal network, Active Directory, applications, databases, and even ATM networks. The test must be performed by qualified security professionals, either from empaneled consulting firms or certified individuals. The test must simulate realistic attack scenarios and attempt to breach critical systems.

**Quarterly vulnerability assessments:** These are automated scans to identify known vulnerabilities in systems. Unlike pentesting (which is manual exploitation), vulnerability assessments use tools like Nessus or Qualys to scan for missing patches, misconfigurations, and weak passwords. Banks must fix high and critical

 vulnerabilities within 30 days and medium vulnerabilities within 90 days.

**Post-implementation testing:** Whenever a bank launches a new application, upgrades infrastructure, or makes major network changes, they must conduct security testing before going live. This ensures new systems don't introduce vulnerabilities.

**Why is this requirement so important?**

Because it creates predictable, recurring demand for pentesting services. Every bank in India - there are over 1,500 bank branches and hundreds of head offices - must do this testing annually. They can't skip it or delay it because RBI auditors specifically check during inspections: "Show me your latest penetration testing report. When was it done? Who did it? What were the findings? What actions did you take?" If a bank can't produce this documentation, RBI issues a notice and may impose monetary penalties.

**What happens if banks don't comply?**

RBI has enforcement powers. Let me give you a real example. In 2020, RBI imposed operational restrictions on HDFC Bank (one of India's largest private banks) for repeated IT outages and cybersecurity lapses. HDFC Bank was temporarily banned from issuing new credit cards and onboarding new digital customers. This continued for several months, causing significant business impact. The bank had to prove they fixed their IT systems and implemented stronger security controls before RBI lifted the restrictions.

This is serious stuff. When RBI takes action, it affects the bank's reputation, stock price, and business operations. Bank CEOs don't want to be in that position. So they ensure compliance, which means hiring pentesters like us to do the mandated security testing.

**How pentesters get engaged through RBI compliance**

Here's the typical flow. A bank's Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) or IT Head receives a reminder from the compliance department: "RBI mandates annual pentest. We need to complete it before March 31st (financial year end) to show in our compliance report." The CISO then reaches out to security consulting firms.

In many cases, banks maintain a list of RBI-empaneled vendors. RBI doesn't officially empanel pentesting firms, but many banks create their own approved vendor list based on firm credentials (like certifications, past experience, insurance coverage). If your firm is on that list, you get invited to submit a proposal. If not, you need to go through a vendor onboarding process which can take 2-3 months.

The CISO sends out a Request for Proposal (RFP) to 3-5 firms asking:

"We need penetration testing of our internet banking platform, mobile app, and internal Active Directory environment. Our domain has 5,000 users across 200 branches. We need the engagement completed within 3 weeks. Please submit your technical approach, timeline, team credentials, and commercial quote."

Security firms respond with detailed proposals. The bank evaluates based on multiple factors: technical expertise (do team members have relevant certifications like OSCP, CEH, CREST?), past experience (have you tested banking environments before?), methodology (are you following OWASP, PTES, or other recognized frameworks?), tools (what scanning and exploitation tools will you use?), insurance coverage (do you have professional indemnity insurance to cover if something breaks?), and of course, price.

After evaluation, the bank selects one firm, signs a contract, and the engagement begins. This entire process from RFP to contract signing typically takes 1-2 months in large banks due to procurement procedures and legal reviews.

#### ISO 27001 Compliance - IT Service Companies

Now let's look at another major compliance driver: ISO 27001 certification. This is huge for Indian IT service companies like TCS, Infosys, Wipro, HCL, and others.

**What is ISO 27001?**

ISO (International Organization for Standardization) is a global body that creates standards for various industries. ISO 27001 is their standard specifically for Information Security Management Systems (ISMS). When a company gets ISO 27001 certified, it means they've proven they follow international best practices for information security.

**Why do IT companies need ISO 27001?**

Here's the business reality. Companies like TCS and Infosys provide IT services to global clients - banks in USA, retailers in UK, manufacturers in Germany, and so on. These international clients handle their own customer data (credit card numbers, health records, personal information)

 and they're outsourcing IT operations to TCS. Before signing those multi-million dollar contracts, the client asks: "How do we know TCS won't leak our customer data? How do we know their security is good enough?"

TCS responds by showing their ISO 27001 certificate. It's proof that an independent auditor (called a certification body) has verified that TCS follows strict security controls. This gives the client confidence. In fact, many client contracts specifically require ISO 27001 certification. The contract might say: "Vendor must maintain valid ISO 27001 certification throughout the contract period. If certification lapses, client can terminate the contract."

So for TCS to win and keep those international contracts worth thousands of crores, they MUST maintain ISO 27001 certification. No certification = lose clients = lose business.

**What does ISO 27001 require for pentesting?**

ISO 27001 standard has a control called A.12.6.1 which states: "Technical vulnerability management: Information about technical vulnerabilities of information systems being used shall be obtained in a timely fashion, the organization's exposure to such vulnerabilities evaluated, and appropriate measures taken to address the associated risk."

In plain English, this means companies must actively look for security weaknesses in their systems and fix them. The standard doesn't explicitly say "you must do pentesting," but during ISO 27001 audits, auditors ask: "How do you find vulnerabilities? Show me your vulnerability management process."

Companies respond by showing their VAPT reports. If a company claims they follow ISO 27001 but can't produce recent security testing reports, the auditor raises a non-conformity. This is a formal finding that must be addressed. If there are too many non-conformities or if critical controls are missing, the certification body can suspend or revoke the ISO 27001 certificate.

This creates direct business pressure. Let me give you a real scenario. Infosys has a major client - let's say a US bank - with a $100 million annual contract. The contract requires Infosys to maintain ISO 27001. Infosys's ISO 27001 certification comes up for renewal (certifications must be renewed every 3 years with annual surveillance audits). During the surveillance audit, the auditor asks: "Show me your latest penetration testing evidence."

Infosys's security team scrambles. They realize their last pentest was done 18 months ago. The auditor says: "ISO 27001 best practice is annual testing. This gap is a non-conformity." Infosys must quickly engage a pentesting firm to conduct testing and close the gap. If they don't fix it before the next audit in 3 months, their certificate could be suspended. If that happens, they must inform their US bank client. The client might panic and start looking for alternative vendors.

You see how this drives demand? Infosys has no choice. They must hire pentesters regularly to maintain compliance, which protects their multi-million dollar contracts.

**How pentesters get engaged through ISO 27001**

Unlike RBI which is India-specific, ISO 27001 is an international standard. IT companies often have global operations - development centers in India, offices in USA, data centers in Singapore. Their ISO 27001 scope covers all these locations. This means they need security testing across multiple regions.

A typical engagement looks like this: Infosys's Global Information Security team (based out of Bangalore) sends out an RFP for annual penetration testing across their top 10 critical applications and 5 major data center networks. The RFP goes to large security consulting firms (EY, Deloitte, PwC) and specialized pentesting companies.

The selected firm must provide a global team - pentesters based in India for testing Indian systems, pentesters in USA for testing American systems (due to data privacy laws and time zone considerations), and so on. The engagement is massive - might cost ₹50-60 lakhs and involve 6-8 pentesters working for 8 weeks across different locations.

For you as a junior pentester working at one of these firms, you might be assigned to test Infosys's internal Active Directory environment at their Electronics City campus in Bangalore. Your senior colleagues handle the international portions. But all of this work exists because of ISO 27001 compliance requirements.

#### PCI DSS Compliance - Payment Card Industry

Let me give you one more major example because this creates enormous pentesting demand: PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard).

**What is PCI DSS?**

PCI DSS is a security standard created by major credit card companies - Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover. Any organization that stores, processes, or transmits credit card data must comply with PCI DSS. This includes online retailers, payment gateways, banks, hotels, airlines - basically any business that accepts credit card payments.

**Why does PCI DSS exist?**

Credit card fraud costs billions of dollars globally every year. When a retailer's systems get hacked and credit card numbers are stolen, customers dispute charges, banks have to refund money, credit card companies suffer reputation damage. To reduce this fraud, Visa and Mastercard created PCI DSS and said: "If you want to accept our cards, you must follow these security requirements."

The enforcement mechanism is brutal. If a retailer suffers a data breach because they weren't PCI DSS compliant, the credit card companies impose massive fines - often millions of dollars. Additionally, the retailer might lose their ability to accept credit cards, which effectively kills their business. No Visa/Mastercard acceptance = most customers can't pay = business shuts down.

**PCI DSS penetration testing requirement**

PCI DSS has very specific penetration testing requirements spelled out in Requirement 11.3:

"Perform external penetration testing at least annually and after any significant infrastructure or application upgrade or modification."

"Perform internal penetration testing at least annually and after any significant infrastructure or application upgrade or modification."

Notice the word "shall" - this is mandatory, not optional. PCI DSS also specifies that penetration testing must:

Be performed by qualified individuals (they define what qualifications mean - either certifications like CREST or demonstrated experience).

Follow industry-accepted penetration testing approaches (like PTES, OWASP, or NIST methodologies).

Include network and application-layer testing.

Test whether segmentation controls (separating card data environment from other networks) are effective.

Include vulnerability research to determine if exploits exist for identified vulnerabilities.

Remediate any exploitable vulnerabilities and retest to confirm fixes.

**This is incredibly detailed. Let me give you a real example.**

Flipkart (India's large e-commerce company) processes millions of credit card transactions. They must be PCI DSS compliant. Every year, they must hire qualified pentesters to test both their external-facing payment systems (the checkout page customers see) and their internal infrastructure (where card data flows to payment processors).

Flipkart engages a firm (let's say PwC) to conduct this assessment. PwC's team does the penetration test over 3-4 weeks. They find vulnerabilities - maybe SQL injection on a test environment, outdated TLS configuration, or insufficient access controls. They document these findings in a detailed report.

Now, Flipkart must fix all high and critical issues. After fixing, PwC comes back and retests (called remediation testing) to verify the fixes work. Only then can Flipkart claim PCI DSS compliance. An independent auditor called a QSA (Qualified Security Assessor) reviews all this documentation and issues a Report on Compliance (ROC) or Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) that proves Flipkart is compliant.

Visa and Mastercard accept this proof and allow Flipkart to continue processing card payments. If Flipkart didn't do the penetration testing or failed to fix critical issues, they'd fail PCI DSS compliance. This would risk their ability to accept cards and cause massive business disruption.

**How pentesters get engaged through PCI DSS**

PCI DSS creates predictable annual work. Every company in the payment ecosystem must do this. In India alone, there are thousands of merchants, payment gateways, processors, and banks in scope. Each needs annual pentesting.

The engagement model is standardized because PCI DSS defines what must be tested. When a client requests PCI DSS pentesting, you already know most of the scope - external perimeter, internal network, web applications that handle card data, segmentation controls. The unknowns are the specifics of their environment (how many IPs, what technologies they use, etc.).

Pricing is also fairly standard. A typical PCI DSS penetration test for a mid-sized e-commerce company might cost ₹3-5 lakhs for external testing and ₹4-6 lakhs for internal testing, plus remediation testing at 50% of initial cost. Larger enterprises pay much more - ₹15-20 lakhs for comprehensive testing.

For you as a pentester, PCI DSS work is attractive because:

It's recurring (annual requirement means clients come back every year).

It's well-defined (clear scope reduces arguments about what's in/out).

It pays well (compliance requirements mean clients can't negotiate too hard on price).

Results matter (you're helping them avoid massive fines and business disruption).

#### Summary - Why Compliance Drives Pentesting Demand

Let me tie this together. Compliance frameworks like RBI guidelines, ISO 27001, and PCI DSS create enormous, predictable demand for penetration testing services in India. Companies don't hire pentesters because they want to - they do it because regulations force them to.

This is good for us as security professionals because:

**Stable demand:** Compliance doesn't go away. RBI isn't going to suddenly say "banks don't need security testing anymore." These requirements are permanent and often get stricter over time.

**Repeat business:** Annual or quarterly requirements mean clients come back regularly. If you do good work, they'll hire you again next year rather than finding someone new.

**Budget allocation:** Compliance-driven projects usually have dedicated budget. When the CISO says "

we must do this for RBI compliance," the finance team approves the budget because it's mandatory spending, not discretionary.

**Professional growth:** Working on compliance engagements exposes you to industry standards, audit processes, and enterprise environments. You learn not just technical hacking but also how businesses operate, how regulations work, and how to communicate with non-technical executives.

Understanding these compliance drivers helps you position yourself as a pentester. When you're in interviews or client meetings, you can speak their language. Instead of saying "I hack stuff," you can say "I help organizations meet RBI compliance requirements through thorough Active Directory penetration testing, ensuring you avoid regulatory penalties and maintain customer trust."

That's exactly what companies want to hear.

## Part 2: How Clients Actually Contact Security Firms

Now that you understand why companies need pentesting (compliance), let's talk about how they actually find and contact security firms. This is important because it affects how you, as an individual pentester, will get assigned to projects.

### Section 2.1: The Corporate Procurement Process

**Wrong assumption people have:** "I'll get my OSCP certification, put up a website, and companies will hire me directly for their pentests."

**Reality:** Large companies almost never hire individual freelance pentesters for major engagements. They hire established security consulting firms through formal procurement processes.

**Why companies prefer hiring firms over individuals:**

Let me explain the business logic. Imagine you're the CISO of HDFC Bank. Your RBI compliance requirement says you must conduct comprehensive AD penetration testing. You have two options:

**Option A:** Hire an independent consultant  
**Option B:** Hire a firm like Deloitte or a specialized security company

If you hire an individual and something goes wrong - the person exploits your production systems during business hours causing downtime, or they leak your sensitive data to competitors, or they just disappear mid-project without completing the work - what recourse do you have? You can sue them personally, but an individual might not have assets to compensate you for millions of rupees in losses. Also, if the individual gets sick or has a personal emergency, your entire project stops.

If you hire a firm, you have institutional backing. The firm has professional indemnity insurance covering ₹5-10 crores. If their pentester breaks something, insurance pays for damages. The firm has multiple consultants, so if one person is unavailable, they send someone else to continue the work. The firm has a reputation to protect - they've been in business for years and have other clients, so they can't afford to behave unprofessionally.

From a legal and risk management perspective, hiring a firm is much safer for the client. This is why 95% of enterprise pentesting work flows through consulting firms, not individual contractors.

**For you as an aspiring pentester, this means:**

Your path forward is typically:  
1. Get certified (OSCP, CEH, CREST, etc.)  
2. Join a security consulting firm as an employee or contractor  
3. Get assigned to client engagements by your firm  
4. Gain experience over 3-5 years  
5. Eventually, maybe start your own firm or become a senior independent consultant with a established reputation

Very few people successfully go directly from "just got certified" to "running independent pentesting engagements for major clients." The industry structure doesn't support that path. Understanding this early prevents frustration. Don't think there's something wrong with you if companies aren't responding to your cold emails. They're not supposed to - they work with established firms.

### Section 2.2: How Companies Find Security Firms

Now let's talk about the actual mechanisms by which companies discover and contact security firms.

#### Empaneled Vendor Lists

Many large enterprises maintain what's called an "empaneled vendor list" or "approved vendor panel." This is a pre-approved list of companies they're allowed to hire for specific services.

**How does a firm get on the panel?**

Let's use State Bank of India (SBI) as an example. SBI needs various IT services - application development, infrastructure management, cybersecurity, etc. Rather than evaluating vendors every single time they need something, SBI creates an empanelment process once every 2-3 years.

SBI publishes a notice saying: "We're empaneling cybersecurity service providers. Interested firms should apply by submitting the following documents: company registration certificates, audited financial statements for last 3 years, client references, team credentials (list of employees with their certifications), insurance coverage details, past project case studies, and commercial rates card."

Security firms across India apply. SBI's procurement committee evaluates all applications based on scoring criteria:

Financial stability (companies with higher annual revenue score better - shows they're established and won't suddenly shut down).

Team size and qualifications (more certified professionals = higher score).

Past experience (have they done similar work for other banks?).

Insurance coverage (higher coverage = lower risk for SBI).

Commercial rates (this is only one factor, not the main factor).

Let's say 50 companies apply. SBI shortlists 15-20 firms that meet minimum criteria and adds them to the empaneled vendor list. This list is valid for 3 years. Whenever SBI needs penetration testing during this period, they only send RFPs to these empaneled vendors, not to random companies.

**Why does this matter for you?**

If you're working for a security firm that's empaneled with SBI, you'll regularly get opportunities to bid on SBI projects. If your firm isn't empaneled, you won't even hear about these opportunities regardless of how good your skills are.

This is another reason why joining an established firm makes sense early in your career. Established firms invest time and effort to get empaneled with major clients. As their employee, you benefit from their existing relationships.

#### Industry Associations and References

Another common way companies find security firms is through industry associations and peer references.

**Example - DSCI (Data Security Council of India):**

DSCI is an industry body focused on cybersecurity. They maintain a list of certified security professionals and companies. Many CISOs who need to hire pentesters start by checking DSCI's directory. DSCI also organizes annual conferences where CISOs and security firms network. A CISO might meet a consulting firm's partner at one of these conferences, exchange business cards, and later send them an RFP when a pentesting need arises.

**Peer references work like this:**

HDFC Bank's CISO hires Deloitte for pentesting. Deloitte does excellent work - thorough testing, clear reporting, professional communication. The HDFC CISO is happy. A few months later, ICICI Bank's CISO (who knows the HDFC CISO through industry forums) calls and asks: "We need to do our annual pentest. Who did you use last time?" HDFC CISO recommends Deloitte. ICICI then directly contacts Deloitte for a proposal.

This is called relationship-based business development. It's extremely common in corporate security consulting. Companies trust recommendations from peers more than marketing websites or cold emails.

**For you as a pentester:**

The quality of your work matters tremendously because it affects your firm's reputation and future business. If you do sloppy work - incomplete testing, unprofessional reports, poor communication - the client won't hire your firm again and won't recommend you to peers. But if you deliver exceptional work, it opens doors to more projects through references.

This is also why experienced consultants maintain professional relationships with client CISOs even after projects end. They might connect on LinkedIn, share security research articles, or meet at conferences. These relationships generate future business.

#### Emergency Engagements - The "Oh Shit" Calls

Sometimes companies contact security firms in panic mode after a breach or security incident.

**Real scenario (details changed for confidentiality):**

Friday 6 PM - A large manufacturing company in Pune gets hit by ransomware. All computers encrypted. Production line stopped. IT team has no idea how attackers got in. CEO demands answers. The CISO googles "incident response companies Pune," finds 3 firms, and calls them all immediately regardless of whether he's worked with them before. This is pure emergency mode.

The first firm that can mobilize a team over the weekend to investigate wins the engagement. Price is secondary - the company is losing ₹5 crores per day in halted production. They'll pay ₹10-15 lakhs for emergency IR and pentesting to understand what happened.

These emergency engagements are stressful but lucrative. Your firm might get a call Saturday morning: "Client got breached. Need 2 people on-site in Pune by tonight. Cancel your weekend plans." You rush to the client location, work 16-hour days for a week doing forensics and pentesting to find how attackers got in, and bill premium rates for the urgency.

**For beginners:**

You probably won't lead these engagements, but you might be the junior person supporting a senior consultant. You'll learn an enormous amount very quickly because real incident response is the ultimate teacher - you see actual attack techniques used by real criminals, not just CTF scenarios.

### Section 2.3: The Initial Client Contact and Sales Process

Let's walk through what happens when a client decides they need pentesting and contacts a security firm.

**Day 1 - Initial Email:**

Client sends email to multiple security firms (usually 3-5 firms to compare quotes). The email is typically brief:

**"Subject: Request for Proposal - AD Penetration Testing**

Dear Sir/Madam,

We are looking to engage a security firm for Active Directory penetration testing of our corporate environment. Our domain has approximately 5,000 users across 20 office locations. We require this engagement to be completed within 4 weeks for compliance requirements.

Please confirm your interest and availability. If interested, we'll send you detailed requirements and NDA for proposal submission.

Regards,  
Rajesh Sharma  
Manager - IT Security  
XYZ Corporation Ltd."

**This email seems simple, but there's a lot happening behind the scenes.**

The client is simultaneously reaching out to multiple firms. They're not committed to anyone yet - just gauging interest and comparing options. The 4-week timeline might be negotiable but gives firms an idea of urgency. Mentioning "compliance requirements" signals this is mandatory work (likely budget-approved).

**Day 1-2: Firm's Response:**

Your firm's sales/delivery manager responds within 24 hours (quick response time matters in competitive bidding):

**"Dear Mr. Sharma,

Thank you for considering ABC Security for your penetration testing requirements. We have extensive experience in Active Directory security assessments for enterprise environments and would be delighted to support XYZ Corporation.

We confirm our interest and availability for a 4-week engagement timeline. Our team includes OSCP and CREST-certified professionals with specific expertise in AD attack techniques.

We're ready to sign your NDA and review detailed requirements. Please share the RFP document and NDA template.

Looking forward to working with you.

Best regards,  
Amit Kumar  
Engagement Manager  
ABC Security Pvt Ltd  
Mobile: +91-9900112233"**

Notice the tone - professional, confident but not arrogant, highlighting relevant qualifications without being pushy. This is corporate communication style.

**Day 3-5: NDA and RFP:**

Client sends two documents:

**1. NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement):** This is a legal contract saying ABC Security won't disclose XYZ Corporation's confidential information to anyone else. Standard business procedure when discussing systems and security details.

**2. RFP (Request for Proposal):** This is a detailed document (usually 10-30 pages) describing exactly what the client wants.

A typical RFP includes:

**Company background:** "XYZ Corporation is a listed manufacturing company with ₹5,000 crore annual revenue. We have 20 offices across India connected via MPLS network."

**Current IT landscape:** "Our Active Directory environment consists of:
- Domain: xyzcorp.local

**Deliverables expected:** "You must provide:
- Executive summary suitable for board presentation  
- Detailed technical report with reproduction steps  
- Evidence files (screenshots, logs, tool outputs)  
- Remediation recommendations with priority rankings  
- Final presentation to IT leadership team"

**Evaluation criteria:** "Proposals will be evaluated on:
- Technical approach and methodology (40%)  
- Team qualifications and experience (25%)  
- Timeline and project plan (15%)  
- Commercial pricing (20%)"

**Submission deadline:** "Please submit your technical and commercial proposal by January 15, 2026, 5 PM IST."

**Point of contact:** Contact details for questions.

**This RFP tells ABC Security exactly what the client wants. Now the firm must decide: do we bid for this project?**

### Section 2.4: Internal Evaluation and Proposal Creation

After receiving the RFP, your firm goes through an internal evaluation process.

**Day 6-7: Feasibility Check:**

The engagement manager (Amit) discusses with the delivery team:

**Amit:** "We got this RFP from XYZ Corporation. 5,000-user AD pentest, end-to-end. They want it done in 4 weeks starting Feb 1st. Can we resource this?"

**Delivery Manager (Priya):** "Let me check team availability." (Checks resource calendar) "We have Rahul (senior), Vamsi (junior), and myself available. Three people should be sufficient. What's the scope?"

**Amit:** "Full AD assessment - external and internal. They also want purple teaming which means we need to coordinate with their SOC team. Client is manufacturing, so business hours might be restrictive."

**Priya:** "Four weeks is tight for full scope, but doable if we don't hit major blockers. I'd recommend proposing 5-6 weeks to give us buffer."

**Amit:** "Commercial perspective - what should we quote?"

**Priya:** "Similar sized engagements we've done were ₹ 6-8 lakhs. Factor in three resources for 4-5 weeks, plus report writing, presentation... I'd say ₹7 lakhs is fair."

**Amit:** "Okay. Let's go ahead with proposal. Priya, can you draft the technical approach section? I'll handle commercial and contractual terms."

**This internal discussion happens before any proposal is sent to the client. Firms don't bid on every RFP - they assess if they have the right people, skills, and capacity.**

**Day 8-12: Proposal Writing:**

Priya sits down to write the technical proposal. This is a critical document that can make or break the deal. A typical technical proposal for this engagement would be 20-25 pages covering:

**1. Understanding of Requirements (2-3 pages):**

Start by paraphrasing what the client asked for, demonstrating you understood their needs. For example:

"XYZ Corporation operates a complex multi-location Active Directory environment supporting 5,000 employees across 20 sites. Your organization requires comprehensive penetration testing to assess security posture against modern attack techniques, particularly focusing on privilege escalation vectors and lateral movement paths. This assessment aligns with your compliance objectives and risk management strategy.

We understand that production stability is paramount. Your manufacturing operations depend on IT systems, so our testing approach must minimize business disruption while maintaining thoroughness. The February timeline allows completion before your fiscal year-end compliance reporting.

Based on the RFP, we identify the following critical testing areas:
- External attack surface reconnaissance and exploitation attempts  
- Internal network enumeration from low-privilege user perspective  
- Active Directory privilege escalation paths (Kerberoasting, AS-REP Roasting, ACL abuse, etc.)  
- Lateral movement techniques and detection evasion  
- Purple teaming exercises in coordination with your SOC team  
- Network segmentation validation between production and QA environments"

This section shows the client you actually read their requirements carefully and understand their business context.

**2. Technical Methodology (5-7 pages):**

Describe exactly how you'll conduct the testing. This is where you demonstrate expertise:

"Our testing methodology follows the Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES) framework, tailored for Active Directory environments. Testing will proceed in distinct phases:

**Phase 1: Information Gathering and Reconnaissance (Days 1-3)**

Our team will begin with passive reconnaissance using open-source intelligence (OSINT) techniques. We'll enumerate publicly available information about XYZ Corporation including employee names from LinkedIn, email address formats, organizational hierarchy, technology stack details from job postings, and external IP ranges from public records. This mimics how real attackers begin their campaigns.

Next, we perform active reconnaissance using network scanning tools like nmap and masscan. We'll map your external attack surface - internet-facing web servers, VPN endpoints, email gateways, and any other exposed services. Each identified service will be fingerprinted to determine version information, which helps identify known vulnerabilities.

For internal reconnaissance (conducted after gaining/being provided initial network access), we'll enumerate the Active Directory environment using tools like BloodHound, PowerView, and ADRecon. These tools help map trust relationships, user/group memberships, service principal names (SPNs), and access control lists (ACLs). The goal is to build a comprehensive picture of your AD architecture and identify potential attack paths leading to Domain Administrator access.

**Phase 2: Threat Modeling and Attack Path Analysis (Days 4-5)**

Using data collected in Phase 1, we'll analyze potential attack vectors specific to your environment. BloodHound will help visualize paths from low-privilege users to high-value targets. We'll identify:
- Users with excessive privileges  
- Service accounts with SPNs (Kerberoasting targets)  
- Users without pre-authentication requirements (AS-REP Roasting targets)  
- Misconfigured ACLs granting unintended permissions  
- Weak password policies or commonly used passwords  
- Delegation misconfigurations  
- Trust relationship vulnerabilities

This analysis allows us to prioritize testing efforts on the most realistic and impactful attack scenarios rather than wasting time on low-probability vectors.

**Phase 3: Exploitation and Privilege Escalation (Days 6-12)**

This is the core testing phase where we actively exploit identified vulnerabilities. Our approach includes:

**Credential-based attacks:**  
We'll attempt password spraying using common passwords against your user base. Industry research shows 5-10% of users in typical organizations use weak passwords like "CompanyName2024" or "Welcome@123". We'll test against your password policy while being careful not to lock out accounts.

If we identify service accounts with registered SPNs, we'll perform Kerberoasting attacks. This involves requesting service tickets encrypted with the service account's password hash, then cracking those tickets offline using powerful GPU-based cracking rigs. Success grants us the service account's credentials.

For users configured without Kerberos pre-authentication, we'll execute AS-REP Roasting to obtain crackable hashes.

**ACL Exploitation:**  
Many AD environments have overly permissive access control lists. If we find that a low-privilege group has GenericAll or WriteDACL permissions on a high-privilege user, we can abuse this to reset the target's password or add ourselves to privileged groups.

**Pass-the-Hash and Pass-the-Ticket:**  
After compromising a workstation or server, we'll attempt credential dumping using tools like Mimikatz. Extracted NTLM hashes or Kerberos tickets can be used to authenticate to other systems without needing plaintext passwords.

**Lateral Movement:**  
Once we escalate privileges on one system, we'll pivot to other targets using techniques like PsExec, WMI, PowerShell Remoting, or RDP. The objective is to demonstrate how an attacker moves through your network to reach critical systems.

**Phase 4: Post-Exploitation and Impact Analysis (Days 13-15)**

Upon achieving Domain Administrator access (which is the typical goal), we'll assess the full impact:
- Can we access sensitive file shares?  
- Can we extract the NTDS.dit database containing all password hashes?  
- Can we create persistence mechanisms (backdoor accounts, Golden Tickets)?  
- What data could an attacker exfiltrate?  
- Could an attacker deploy ransomware domain-wide?

We'll document these findings with clear proof-of-concept evidence but will NOT actually exfiltrate production data or deploy disruptive payloads.

**Phase 5: Purple Teaming and Detection Assessment (Days 16-18)**

In coordination with your SOC team, we'll review which of our attack activities were detected and which went unnoticed. This provides valuable feedback on your monitoring capabilities.

We'll generate sample attack scenarios and observe if your SIEM, EDR, or other security tools generated appropriate alerts. For example:
- Did our BloodHound enumeration trigger alerts?  
- Were Kerberoasting attempts logged and flagged?  
- Did credential dumping with Mimikatz get blocked or detected by EDR?  
- Were lateral movement attempts via PsExec caught by network monitoring?

This purple teaming exercise helps improve your defensive posture by identifying blind spots.

**Phase 6: Reporting and Presentation (Days 19-21)**

The final three days are dedicated to comprehensive documentation. We'll produce:

An executive summary (3-5 pages) tailored for C-suite and board members. This will explain findings in business terms - what risks exist, what's the potential impact, how urgently should remediation occur, and what resources are needed.

A technical report (30-50 pages) targeting your IT and security teams. Each vulnerability will include:
- Clear description of the issue  
- Step-by-step reproduction procedure with exact commands and screenshots  
- Affected systems list  
- Risk rating (Critical, High, Medium, Low) with CVSS scoring  
- Detailed remediation guidance  
- References to industry standards (CIS benchmarks, Microsoft security baselines)

We'll also provide a findings presentation (PowerPoint, 1 hour duration) that we'll deliver to your IT leadership team. This presentation facilitates discussion and helps align remediation priorities."

**This level of detail shows the client you know exactly what you're doing. You're not just saying "we'll hack your AD" - you're explaining the precise methodology, tools, and expected outcomes.**

- Client will designate a technical point of contact available for queries  
- Testing will be limited to agreed scope; additional systems require SOW amendment  
- Client will not hold ABC Security liable for business disruption during agreed testing windows  
- GST (18%) will be charged as applicable"

**This proposal becomes your bible for the project. Everything you put in the proposal, you must deliver. Don't overpromise.**

**Day 13-14: Proposal Submission:**

Amit compiles all sections, adds company branding, gets it reviewed by senior leadership, and submits to the client exactly on the deadline (January 15, 5 PM). Late submissions are often rejected outright.

**Day 15-20: Client Evaluation:**

The client evaluates all proposals they received (from ABC Security and competitors). They might:
- Create a comparison matrix scoring each firm
- Shortlist top 2-3 firms for presentations
- Negotiate on price or scope  
- Request clarifications on technical approach

Sometimes clients request a "pre-sales call" where you present your proposal and answer questions. This is your chance to shine - explain your methodology, demonstrate expertise, build rapport.

**Day 21: Award Notification:**

If you win, the client sends an email: "We're pleased to inform you that XYZ Corporation has selected ABC Security for this engagement. Please proceed with contract formalization."

If you lose, they might inform you politely: "Thank you for your proposal. We've decided to engage another vendor for this requirement. We appreciate your time and would welcome future opportunities to work together."

Losing bids is normal. Even large firms win only 30-40% of opportunities they bid on. Competition is fierce.

**For you as the pentester:**

You were probably involved minimally in this sales process - maybe Priya asked you to help research tools or review technical sections of the proposal. But senior people (engagement managers, delivery managers) handle most of the sales and proposal work.

Your job starts after the contract is signed - that's when you get assigned to the project and start actual testing.

**However, understanding this entire flow helps you:**
- Appreciate the business development effort that brings projects
- Understand why project scopes are sometimes tight (sales negotiated hard on price and timeline to win)
- Recognize the importance of delivering exactly what was promised (because proposal commitments are legally binding)
- Build respect for the non-technical work (sales, proposal writing) that enables you to have interesting pentesting projects

This is the reality of corporate security consulting. It's not just hacking - it's a complete business ecosystem.

**[TO BE CONTINUED...]**

This is Part 1 covering client acquisition and the sales process with proper depth. Part 2 will cover SOW, ROE, authorization letters, network access methods, and actual engagement execution - all with the same detailed explanations.

## Part 3: Statement of Work (SOW) - The Legal Contract That Protects You

After your firm wins the bid and the client sends the award notification, the next critical step is formalizing everything through a Statement of Work. This isn't just paperwork - this document can save you from lawsuits, protect you from false accusations, and ensure you get paid. Let me explain what an SOW actually is and why every single clause matters.

### Section 3.1: Understanding What an SOW Really Is

The Statement of Work is essentially a legally binding contract between your security firm and the client company. Think of it as the rulebook for the entire engagement. Everything - and I mean everything - that happens during the pentesting project must align with what's written in this SOW. If something isn't explicitly mentioned in the SOW, you technically can't do it without getting a formal amendment signed.

Here's the reality that many beginners don't understand: verbal agreements mean nothing in Indian business law. Let's say during a casual phone call, the client's IT manager says "Oh, while you're testing AD, can you also quickly check our web application?" You say "Sure, no problem" and spend two days testing their web app. Later, when you submit your invoice, the client's finance department rejects it saying "We only contracted for AD testing. Web app testing wasn't in scope. We're not paying for that work."

You might argue "But your IT manager asked me to!" Unfortunately, unless that request came through a formal SOW amendment signed by both companies, you have no legal basis to demand payment. You just did two days of unpaid work. This happens more often than you'd think, especially with Indian companies where verbal requests are common but contract enforcement is strict.

The SOW prevents these situations by documenting everything in writing. When both parties sign the SOW, they're legally agreeing to its terms. If later there's any dispute - about scope, timeline, deliverables, or payment - you pull out the signed SOW and say "Here's what we agreed to." Courts and arbitrators in India heavily rely on written contracts. The SOW is your evidence.

**What makes an SOW legally enforceable in India?**

For an SOW to be legally valid under Indian Contract Act 1872, it must meet certain criteria. First, there must be a clear offer and acceptance. Your firm offers to perform pentesting services under specific terms, and the client accepts those terms by signing. Second, there must be consideration - meaning something of value exchanged. You provide penetration testing services (your expertise and time), they provide payment (money). Third, both parties must have legal capacity to enter contracts - they must be registered companies authorized to conduct business.

Fourth, there must be free consent. Neither party should be forced or tricked into signing. If a client later claims "We were pressured into signing this SOW under time constraints," they could argue the contract is voidable. That's why proper SOW processes involve giving clients adequate time to review before signing. Fifth, the contract's object must be lawful. Pentesting is legal when authorized, so this criterion is met as long as scope is clearly defined.

Finally, both parties must intend to create legal relations. This is usually implicit in business contracts but some SOWs explicitly state "This agreement is intended to be legally binding." These elements transform the SOW from a simple document into a contract that courts will enforce.

### Section 3.2: SOW Structure - Breaking Down Each Critical Section

Let me walk through a real SOW structure section by section, explaining what goes into each part and why it's there. I'm using a realistic example based on actual SOWs used in the Indian IT security consulting industry.

**SECTION 1: IDENTIFICATION OF PARTIES**

This opening section identifies exactly who is entering into this agreement. It sounds obvious, but getting this right matters tremendously for legal enforceability.

Example text:
"This Statement of Work ("Agreement") is executed on this 1st day of February, 2026 ("Effective Date") by and between:

**PARTY A (CLIENT):**
XYZ Manufacturing Private Limited, a private company incorporated under the Companies Act, 2013, having its registered office at Survey No. 45/2, MIDC Industrial Area, Hinjewadi Phase III, Pune - 411057, Maharashtra, India, represented by its authorized signatory Mr. Rajesh Kumar Sharma, Chief Information Security Officer, acting within the scope of his authority as per Board Resolution dated January 15, 2026 (hereinafter referred to as "Client" or "XYZ")

**PARTY B (SERVICE PROVIDER):**
ABC Security Consulting Private Limited, a private company incorporated under the Companies Act, 2013 , having its registered office at 5th Floor, Tower B, Divyasree Omega, HITEC City, Hyderabad - 500081, Telangana, India, represented by its authorized signatory Mr. Amit Kumar Verma, Director - Consulting Services, acting within the scope of his authority as per Board Resolution dated January 20, 2026 (hereinafter referred to as "Service Provider" or "ABC Security")

Collectively referred to as ("Parties") and individually as ("Party")"

**Why this level of legal detail?**

Every element here serves a purpose. The full legal names of both companies matter because these are the entities legally bound. If XYZ Manufacturing has multiple subsidiaries and you accidentally write "XYZ Technologies" (a different legal entity), you might later discover you can't enforce the contract against the actual client.

The incorporation details under Companies Act 2013 establish that both are legitimate Indian companies. This becomes important if there's a dispute requiring court intervention - you need to prove the other party is a legally recognized entity that can be sued.

The registered office addresses are crucial because they determine jurisdiction. If you need to file a lawsuit for non-payment, the company's registered address tells you which court has jurisdiction. In India's legal system, you generally file civil suits in the court having jurisdiction over the defendant's registered office location. So if XYZ's registered office is in Pune and you're in Hyderabad, any lawsuit would likely be filed in Pune courts.

The "authorized signatory" clause is extremely important. Not everyone at a company can legally bind it to contracts. Usually, directors, CEOs, or specifically authorized officers can sign. The reference to board resolutions proves the person signing has explicit authority from the company's board of directors to enter into this contract. If someone unauthorized signs (say, a junior IT manager), the company could later claim the contract is invalid because that person lacked authority.

This actually happened in a case I'm aware of: A security firm entered into an SOW signed by a client's "Manager - IT Infrastructure." Later, when the firm tried to enforce payment, the client argued that manager had no authority to sign contracts above ₹5 lakhs, and this engagement was ₹8 lakhs. The client refused payment, and the security firm had to fight a legal battle. They eventually won, but it took months and significant legal costs. Always verify the signatory's authority.

**SECTION 2: RECITALS OR BACKGROUND**

This section provides context - why is this agreement being created? What's the business situation? While not strictly legally necessary, recitals help interpret ambiguous clauses later.

Example:
"WHEREAS, the Client operates a manufacturing business across 20 facilities in India, managing a Windows Active Directory infrastructure with approximately 5,000 user accounts and 6,000 computer endpoints;

WHEREAS, the Client is required to comply with ISO 27001 information security standards as mandated by certain customer contracts, and such compliance requires regular penetration testing of critical IT infrastructure;

WHEREAS, the Client seeks to engage qualified cybersecurity professionals to conduct comprehensive Active Directory penetration testing to identify security vulnerabilities, assess privilege escalation risks, and provide remediation recommendations;

WHEREAS, ABC Security possesses expertise, qualified personnel, and experience in conducting Active Directory penetration testing for enterprise environments;

WHEREAS, both Parties desire to enter into this Agreement to define the terms, scope, responsibilities, and commercial arrangements for such penetration testing services;

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, terms, and conditions set forth herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows:"

**Why have all these "WHEREAS" clauses?**

They establish mutual intent and understanding. If a dispute arises later about what was intended, these recitals provide context. For example, if during testing you avoid certain systems that might disrupt manufacturing operations, and the client later complains you didn't test everything, you can point to the recital acknowledging "Client operates manufacturing business" - establishing that both parties understood production continuity was important.

Recitals also sometimes establish facts that support later claims. If the client doesn't provide access as promised and you need to prove they were obligated to, you can refer to the recital where they acknowledged needing to "engage qualified professionals" - implying they'd cooperate by providing access.

Legally, recitals aren't usually enforceable as contract terms themselves, but Indian courts do consider them when interpreting operational clauses. They're basically the preamble that explains why the contract exists.

**SECTION 3: SCOPE OF SERVICES**

This is the absolute heart of the SOW. This section defines precisely what you will do and what you won't do. Getting scope wrong causes 90% of client disputes in the pentesting industry.

Let me show you how to write scope properly with enough detail to prevent arguments:

"**3. SCOPE OF SERVICES**

- Actual data exfiltration of production/customer data (proof-of-concept screenshots only)
- Deletion or modification of production data
- Deployment of malware, ransomware simulators, or destructive payloads
- Testing during blackout periods: Weekends, public holidays, month-end close (last 3 days of each month)
- Testing of systems located outside India (for US/Europe offices, separate engagement required due to data sovereignty laws)

**3.2.3 Handling Accidental Out-of-Scope Access:**

In the event ABC Security inadvertently accesses any out-of-scope system, the following immediate actions are required:

1. Cease all activity instantly (no further commands, queries, or access attempts)
2. Document exact actions taken: timestamp, system accessed, commands executed, data viewed
3. Immediately notify Client's designated Point of Contact (initially via phone, then email within 15 minutes)
4. Provide detailed incident report within 24 hours explaining how the access occurred and remedial actions taken
5. Delete any screenshots, logs, or artifacts related to the out-of-scope access

**3.5 ASSUMPTIONS AND DEPENDENCIES**

This SOW is based on the following assumptions. If these assumptions prove incorrect, scope/timeline/ pricing may need to be revisited:

**Client Responsibilities:**
- Client will provide VPN access (Cisco AnyConnect or equivalent) within 2 business days of engagement start
- VPN will provide full internal network access (not segregated or restricted)
- Test user accounts will be created and credentials shared before testing commences
- Client will designate a Technical Point of Contact (TPOC) available during testing hours for queries/clarifications
- TPOC will respond to queries within 4 business hours
- Client will not make major infrastructure changes during testing period (no DC upgrades, domain migrations, network reconfigurations)
- Client will inform ABC Security of any scheduled maintenance/outage windows in advance

**ABC Security Responsibilities:**
- Consultants will maintain professional conduct and confidentiality
- Daily status emails will be sent by 7:00 AM IST each morning
- Critical findings will be escalated immediately (within 2 hours of discovery)
- All testing will be performed from India-based infrastructure (no offshore testing)
- Tools used will be industry-standard, legally obtained, and malware-free

**Technical Assumptions:**
- Active Directory environment is running Windows Server 2016 or later
- Network connectivity between ABC Security's VPN endpoint and all in-scope subnets is available
- Domain Controllers are reachable and operational
- Basic AD security (not hardened per Microsoft Tier 0 model) - if environment is highly hardened, additional time may be required
- English language for documentation and interfaces (if systems use other languages, translation time may be needed)

If any assumption proves invalid, either Party may request scope adjustment, timeline extension, or pricing revision via written amendment."

**Why are assumptions sections so important?**

Because they establish baseline expectations for both parties. If during testing you discover the client's AD environment is actually running Windows Server 2012 (older than assumed) and you encounter compatibility issues with your testing tools, you can point to the assumption section and say "We assumed Server 2016 or later. This changes the effort required. We need to adjust timeline or bring in specialized tools." The client can't argue about scope creep because the assumption was explicitly stated upfront.

Similarly, if the client doesn't provide VPN access within 2 days and causes a week's delay, you're not penalized for missing the deadline. The SOW clearly stated client was responsible for timely VPN provisioning. If they breach that responsibility, timeline extension is justified.

Assumptions protect both sides. They force both parties to think through preconditions needed for success and document them formally.

**SECTION 4: COMMERCIAL TERMS AND PRICING**

Now we get to money - the most sensitive part of any SOW. Commercial terms must be crystal clear to avoid payment disputes. Let me show you how professional SOWs structure pricing.

"**4. COMMERCIAL TERMS**

**4.1 Professional Services Fees:**

The Client shall pay ABC Security for penetration testing services as follows:

**Base Engagement Fee:** ₹6,80,000 (Six Lakhs Eighty Thousand Indian Rupees Only)

This fee is inclusive of:
- 21 consulting days (3 senior/mid/junior consultants working full-time for 7 business days each)
- All pentesting tools, licenses, and infrastructure costs (nmap, Nessus, BloodHound, Metasploit, etc.)
- Secure testing environment setup and teardown
- All deliverables specified in Section 3.4 (Executive Summary, Technical Report, Evidence Package, Remediation Guide, Presentation)
- Travel costs for in-person presentation at Client's Mumbai office (if required)
- One round of clarifications/questions after report delivery

This fee does NOT include:
- Remediation implementation (Client's IT team responsibility)
- Post-remediation testing (quoted separately below)
- Training for Client's IT staff
- Ongoing security consulting beyond this engagement
- Testing of out-of-scope systems (requires separate SOW)

**Optional Add-On Services:**

**Remediation Validation Testing:** ₹1,50,000 (One Lakh Fifty Thousand Rupees Only)
- Includes: 5 additional consulting days
- To be performed after Client implements recommended fixes
- Focused retesting of previously identified vulnerabilities only
- Verification report confirming remediation effectiveness
- Sign-off on closed findings

**Timeline Extension:** ₹50,000 per additional business day
- If Client requests timeline extension beyond February 28, 2026
- Subject to ABC Security consultant availability
- Minimum increment: 2 business days

**4.2 Payment Schedule:**

Payments shall be made in Indian Rupees (INR) according to the following schedule:

**First Installment (Advance Payment):** ₹3,40,000 (50% of base fee)
- Due: Within 5 business days of SOW execution (signing)
- Payment triggers: Engagement kickoff and commencement of testing
- If advance not received within 5 business days, ABC Security may postpone engagement start date

**Second Installment (Final Payment):** ₹3,40,000 (remaining 50% of base fee)
- Due: Within 10 business days of Technical Report delivery
- Payment triggers: Report acceptance and release of final deliverables
- Late payment attracts 2% per month interest as per Indian law

**For Optional Services:**
- Remediation Validation Testing: 100% payable in advance before retesting commences
- Timeline Extensions: Payable within 3 business days of extension request approval

**Why this payment structure?**

The 50-50 split protects both parties. ABC Security gets 50% upfront, ensuring they're not providing free services if the client backs out mid-project or refuses to pay later. The client retains 50% until delivery, ensuring ABC Security completes the work to satisfactory standards before receiving full payment.

This is standard in Indian IT consulting. You'll rarely see 100% advance (too risky for client) or 100% on completion (too risky for service provider). The 50-50 model balances risk fairly.

The 5-day advance payment window is crucial. It gives the client's finance department reasonable time to process payment (approvals, fund transfers), but also creates urgency. If clients had unlimited time to pay, engagements would never start. Some companies take months to pay if there's no contractual deadline.

The 10-day final payment window after report delivery is also strategically chosen. It's long enough for the client to review findings and verify the report meets expectations, but short enough that ABC Security isn't waiting indefinitely for payment. The 2% monthly interest clause for late payment is enforceable under Indian Contract Act and provides incentive for timely payment.

**4.3 Taxes and Duties:**

All fees quoted above are exclusive of Goods and Services Tax (GST) and other applicable taxes. Current GST rate for consulting services in India is 18%.

**Invoice Breakdown Example:**
- Base Engagement Fee: ₹6,80,000
- Add: GST @18%: ₹1,22,400
- **Total Invoice Value: ₹8,02,400**

Client shall be responsible for payment of all applicable taxes. ABC Security shall provide GST-compliant tax invoices for all payments.

If there are changes in tax rates or new taxes imposed by Indian government during the engagement period, such changes shall be borne by the Client, and invoice amounts adjusted accordingly.

**Why explicitly mention GST?**

Because tax confusion causes payment delays. If your SOW says "₹6,80,000" without clarifying whether GST is included or excluded, the client might think total payment is ₹6.8 lakhs. When you send an invoice for ₹8.02 lakhs (including GST), they'll be shocked and claim you're overcharging. Disputes arise, payments get stuck in finance department review, and your project cash flow suffers.

By explicitly stating "fees exclusive of GST" and showing example calculations, you prevent misunderstandings. The client knows from day one that the total outflow will be approximately ₹8 lakhs, not ₹6.8 lakhs. Their finance team budgets accordingly.

**4.4 Payment Method:**

Payments shall be made via:
- Bank transfer (NEFT/RTGS/IMPS) to ABC Security's designated bank account
- Cheque drawn in favor of "ABC Security Consulting Private Limited"
- Online payment portal (if available)

Payment details:
- Beneficiary Name: ABC Security Consulting Private Limited
- Bank Name: HDFC Bank Limited
- Branch: HITEC City, Hyderabad
- Account Number: 1234567890
- IFSC Code: HDFC0001234
- Account Type: Current Account

Client shall provide payment confirmation (UTR number or transaction receipt) to ABC Security within 24 hours of payment.

**4.5 Late Payment Consequences:**

If Client fails to make payment within stipulated timelines:

For advance payment delay:
- ABC Security reserves the right to postpone engagement start date until payment is received
- Original timeline commitments (report delivery by Feb 27) become void if start is delayed
- New timeline to be mutually agreed based on when payment is actually received

For final payment delay:
- ABC Security may withhold certain deliverables (editable report in Word format, source evidence files) until payment is received, while providing the core deliverable (PDF technical report) to allow the client to begin remediation
- Interest @2% per month (or part thereof) applies on overdue amount
- Future engagement opportunities may be affected (client marked as "slow payer" internally)

For delays exceeding 30 days:
- ABC Security may initiate legal recovery proceedings
- Client shall be liable for all legal costs, collection charges, and damages

**Why have these harsh late payment clauses?**

Because payment delays are extremely common in Indian corporate environment. Finance departments are notorious for sitting on invoices, asking for endless clarifications, or simply prioritizing other payments. Without contractual teeth, you could deliver excellent work in February and not get paid until June.

The withholding of deliverables clause is your leverage. If you've already handed over everything and the client has all the value, they have zero incentive to pay quickly. But if you hold back the editable Word version or evidence files, they'll want those for their remediation work, creating pressure to pay.

The 2% monthly interest is actually quite reasonable - it's below typical bank loan rates (8-10% annually vs 24% annually in this case). But it sends a message: late payment has consequences.

The 30-day legal action clause is your ultimate protection. It tells the client "We're serious about timely payment. Don't test us." Most disputes get resolved before this point because no company wants legal fights over payment - it damages reputation.

**SECTION 5: LEGAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS**

This section covers liability, indemnity, confidentiality, and other legal protections. It's dense legal language, but every clause exists for a reason. Let me break it down:

"**5. LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION**

**5.1 ABC Security's Liability Limitations:**

ABC Security's maximum aggregate liability to Client for any and all claims arising from this engagement, whether based on contract, negligence, strict liability, or otherwise, shall not exceed the total fees actually paid by Client under this SOW.

For example, if total fees paid are ₹6,80,000, ABC Security's maximum liability is capped at ₹6,80,000.

ABC Security shall NOT be liable for:
- Indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages
- Loss of profits, revenue, data, or business opportunities
- Business interruption or system downtime occurring during authorized testing windows
- Damages resulting from Client's failure to implement recommended remediation in a timely manner
- Third-party claims arising from vulnerabilities that existed before ABC Security's testing

**5.2 Exceptions to Liability Limitations:**

The above liability limitations shall NOT apply to:
- ABC Security's gross negligence or willful misconduct
- Testing performed outside agreed scope without authorization
- Breach of confidentiality obligations
- Infringement of third-party intellectual property rights

**5.3 Client Indemnification:**

Client agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless ABC Security, its employees, contractors, and agents from and against any and all claims, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees) arising from:

- Client's breach of this Agreement
- Client providing inaccurate information about in-scope vs out-of-scope systems
- Third-party claims alleging that ABC Security's authorized testing violated laws or rights (provided ABC Security acted within the scope defined herein)
- Claims by Client's employees regarding privacy violations during authorized testing

**Why these liability clauses?**

Pentesting is inherently risky. You're literally attacking client systems, trying to break in. Things can go wrong - maybe an aggressive scan crashes an old server, or exploiting a vulnerability causes unintended side effects. Without liability caps, you could face claims for millions of rupees if something breaks.

The liability cap tied to fees paid is standard in professional services. The logic is: you can't be liable for more than you earned. If a client paid you ₹6.8 lakhs for a pentest, they can't later sue you for ₹50 lakhs in damages. Maximum you pay back is what you earned.

The exclusions for indirect/consequential damages are crucial. Imagine this scenario: You test a client's AD environment during agreed hours (8 PM - 6 AM). An unexpected exploit crashes a domain controller. It takes the client 4 hours to restore from backup. During those 4 hours, their manufacturing plant can't operate (needs AD for authentication). They lose ₹2 crore in production.

Without the "no consequential damages" clause, they could sue you for ₹2 crores, arguing your testing caused their business loss. With the clause, they can't. You're only liable for direct damages (cost to restore the DC, maybe), not the downstream business impact. This protects you from catastrophic claims.

The client indemnification clause protects you from third-party lawsuits. For example, if an employee sues the client claiming "the pentester invaded my privacy by accessing my files," the client must defend you and cover legal costs. This is fair because you were acting on the client's authorization.

**5.4 Insurance Coverage:**

ABC Security maintains the following insurance policies:

**Professional Indemnity Insurance:** ₹5 Crore coverage
- Policy Number: PI-2025-1234567
- Insurer: ICICI Lombard General Insurance
- Coverage: Claims arising from professional errors, omissions, or negligence
- Valid until: December 31, 2026

**Cyber Liability Insurance:** ₹2 Crore coverage
- Policy Number: CYB-2025-7654321
- Insurer: Bajaj Allianz General Insurance
- Coverage: Data breaches, privacy violations, cyber incidents
- Valid until: December 31, 2026

ABC Security shall maintain these insurance coverages throughout the engagement period and provide certificates of insurance to Client upon request.

**Why mention insurance?"**

It gives clients confidence. If something goes seriously wrong and exceeds your ability to pay personally or as a company, insurance steps in. A client is more willing to let you test their critical systems if they know you're not some fly-by-night operation - you have ₹5 crore professional indemnity coverage backing you.

For larger enterprise clients, having insurance is often mandatory. Their procurement policies might require vendors to have minimum insurance coverage (e.g., "vendors must carry PI insurance of at least ₹2 crores"). If you don't have it, you're auto-rejected from bidding.

Insurance also affects pricing. Having insurance costs money (premiums can be ₹2-5 lakhs annually for security consulting firms), but it allows you to charge premium rates. Uninsured freelancers might charge ₹2-3 lakhs for the same work, but clients prefer paying ₹6-8 lakhs to an insured firm because of risk mitigation.

**5.5 Confidentiality:**

Both parties acknowledge that during this engagement, they will have access to confidential information.

**ABC Security's Confidentiality Obligations:**

ABC Security agrees to:
- Treat all information accessed during testing as strictly confidential
- Not disclose Client's confidential information to any third party without written consent
- Use confidential information solely for purposes of performing services under this  SOW
- Implement reasonable security measures to protect confidential information (encrypted storage, access controls, secure transmission)
- Return or destroy all confidential information within 30 days of engagement completion (except one copy retained for legal/audit purposes)
- Not use Client's name as a reference or in marketing materials without prior written permission

Confidential information includes but is not limited to: network architecture diagrams, system configurations, password hashes captured during testing, vulnerability findings, source code, business data, employee information, and any information marked "Confidential."

Exceptions (information ABC Security may disclose):
- Information that becomes publicly available through no fault of ABC Security
- Information ABC Security can prove was already known before this engagement
- Information independently developed by ABC Security without using Client's confidential data
- Information required to be disclosed by law or court order (with prior notice to Client)

Confidentiality obligations survive engagement termination and continue for 3 years after engagement completion.

**Client's Confidentiality Obligations:**

Client agrees to:
- Treat ABC Security's testing methodologies, tools, scripts, and techniques as confidential
- Not share ABC Security's deliverables with third parties without consent (except as needed for remediation or compliance purposes)
- Not reverse-engineer or replicate ABC Security's proprietary testing tools

**Why mutual confidentiality?**

It protects both sides. You're protecting their data, they're protecting your intellectual property (methodologies, custom scripts). Fair exchange.

The 30-day data destruction clause is important for data protection compliance. Under India's evolving data privacy laws and international standards like GDPR, you can't keep client data indefinitely. After the engagement, you have no business reason to retain their sensitive information. Deleting it reduces your liability and shows professional data handling.

The "except one copy for legal/audit" exception is necessary because if a dispute arises 2 years later, you need evidence of what you tested, what you found, and what you reported. That one retained copy (stored securely) is your protection.

The 3-year survival period for confidentiality is standard in Indian contracts. It gives reasonable protection without being perpetual (which courts sometimes reject as unreasonable).

**5.6 Intellectual Property:**

**Ownership of Deliverables:**

Upon full payment of all fees, Client shall own all deliverables created specifically for them under this engagement (reports, presentations, remediation guides specific to their environment).

ABC Security retains ownership of:
- Pre-existing tools, scripts, methodologies, and frameworks used during testing
- Generic knowledge, techniques, and experience gained
- Templates and standard operating procedures
- Rights to use de-identified findings for research, training, or methodology improvement

Neither party may use the other's trademarks, logos, or brand names without written permission.

**Why split IP ownership?**

Because both parties contributed value and both should benefit. The client paid for the engagement, so they own the specific outputs (the report about their environment). But you developed your testing tools and methodologies over years - clients can't claim ownership of those just because they hired you for one project.

The "de-identified findings for research" clause is valuable for your firm. It allows you to say things like "In a recent banking client engagement, we found 60% of service accounts had weak passwords" in your white papers or conference talks. You're not violating confidentiality (not naming the client), but you're building your brand as thought leaders. This attracts future clients.

**5.7 Dispute Resolution:**

In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this SOW:

**Step 1: Good Faith Negotiation (30 days)**
Parties shall first attempt to resolve the dispute through good faith negotiations between senior management representatives (Director level or above).

**Step 2: Mediation (60 days)**
If negotiation fails, parties agree to submit the dispute to mediation before a mutually acceptable mediator in Bangalore, India. Mediation costs shall be shared equally.

**Step 3: Arbitration**
If mediation fails, the dispute shall be finally resolved by arbitration in accordance with the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.

Arbitration terms:
- Seat of Arbitration: Bangalore, Karnataka, India
- Number of Arbitrators: One (if claim value < ₹50 lakhs) or Three (if ≥ ₹50 lakhs)
- Language: English
- Arbitrator appointment: By mutual agreement, or if parties can't agree, by Chairman of Bangalore Arbitration Centre
- Arbitration award shall be final and binding on both parties

**Step 4: Litigation (Last Resort)**
If arbitration is not feasible for any legal reason, disputes shall be subject to exclusive jurisdiction of courts in Bangalore, Karnataka, India.

**Why this escalation structure?**

Because litigation in Indian courts is slow and expensive. A simple contract dispute can take 5-10 years to resolve in civil courts. Meanwhile, both parties are spending lakhs on lawyers, the relationship is destroyed, and business suffers.

The mandatory negotiation and mediation steps create opportunities to settle disputes quickly. Maybe there's a genuine misunderstanding that can be clarified in a 1-hour meeting between directors. Why spend ₹20 lakhs on lawyers when you can resolve it over coffee?

Arbitration is much faster than courts (typically 6-12 months vs. 5-10 years for litigation). Arbitrators are usually retired judges or legal experts who understand commercial matters. The award is enforceable in courts, so winners can actually collect.

The Bangalore jurisdiction clause is important. Without it, if a client in Delhi sues you and you're based in Hyderabad, there could be battles over which court has jurisdiction. By pre-agreeing on Bangalore, you avoid that fight. (You'd typically choose a neutral city or a location convenient for both parties.)

**5.8 Termination:**

**Termination for Convenience:**

Either party may terminate this SOW with 10 business days written notice.

Upon termination by Client:
- Client pays for all work completed up to termination date on pro-rata basis
- Client pays 25% of remaining fees as termination fee
- ABC Security delivers work-in-progress findings (if any)

Upon termination by ABC Security (only if Client materially breaches SOW):
- ABC Security refunds unearned portion of advance payment
- ABC Security has no further obligations

**Termination for Cause:**

Either party may immediately terminate if the other party:
- Materially breaches this SOW and fails to cure within 15 days of written notice
- Becomes insolvent, bankrupt, or subject to receivership
- Engages in fraud, gross negligence, or illegal activities

**Effects of Termination:**

Upon termination by either party:
- All payment obligations for services rendered remain in effect
- Confidentiality and IP clauses survive termination
- Both parties return or destroy each other's confidential information (except legally required retention)

**Why have termination clauses?**

Relationships sometimes don't work out. Maybe after kickoff, you discover the client's environment is vastly more complex than scoped, and you can't deliver quality results in the time contracted. Rather than doing shoddy work and damaging your reputation, you might prefer to terminate and refund.

Or maybe the client's business priorities change mid-project (their CFO decides budget should be reallocated elsewhere). They need an exit path that's clear and fair.

The 25% termination fee for client-initiated termination protects your firm. If a client terminates after you've done 3 days of work out of 21 days planned, you've consumed resources (consultant time that could've been sold to other clients). The termination fee compensates for opportunity cost and disruption.

The termination-for-cause provisions protect both parties from having to continue a relationship with a party that's behaving badly. If a client repeatedly refuses to provide promised access or constantly changes scope without amendments, you should be able to walk away."

## Part 4: Rules of Engagement (ROE) - The Technical Operating Manual

The SOW told us *what* we're going to test and *when*. The Rules of Engagement (ROE) document tells us *exactly how* to conduct the testing from a technical perspective. Think of the SOW as the business contract and the ROE as the technical playbook.

### Section 4.1: Understanding What Makes ROE Different from SOW

Many beginners confuse SOW and ROE, thinking they're the same thing. They're not. Let me explain the distinction clearly because it's important for both legal protection and operational clarity.

The SOW is a legal contract between two companies. It's written in formal legal language, covers commercial terms, liabilities, and high-level scope. It gets signed by directors or authorized signatories. It's enforceable in court. The primary audience is legal/finance teams and company leadership.

The ROE is a technical appendix or supplementary document. It's written in operational language that IT teams and pentesters understand. It contains detailed technical specifications: exact IP addresses to test, tools allowed, attack rate limits, communication protocols, emergency procedures. It usually gets approved by the client's CISO or IT Security Head (not necessarily board-level signature). While ROE is contractually binding (often referenced in the SOW as "Testing shall be conducted per attached ROE"), its primary audience is the technical teams actually doing the work.

Here's an analogy: When you buy a car, the sales contract (SOW equivalent) says "Customer purchases one Honda City VX, price ₹15 lakhs, delivery in 2 weeks." The car's user manual (ROE equivalent) says "Recommended tire pressure: 32 PSI, oil change every 10,000 km, don't exceed 3000 RPM during first 1000 km break-in period." Both documents govern your relationship with the car, but serve different purposes.

Why have both documents? Because legal teams who draft SOWs often don't understand technical details like "maximum nmap scan rate" or "Kerberoasting parameters." And pentesters who need those details shouldn't have to decipher 50 pages of legal jargon to figure out what they're allowed to do. Separating SOW (legal) from ROE (technical) makes both documents more useful to their respective audiences.

Some firms combine SOW and ROE into one document with two sections. That works too. But in large enterprise engagements, they're typically separate documents, with the SOW stating "ABC Security shall conduct testing in accordance with the Rules of Engagement attached as Appendix A."

### Section 4.2: Real ROE Document Structure and Content

Let me show you what a real, professional ROE document looks like for our Active Directory pentesting engagement. I'll include the actual technical details you need, explained fully so you understand why each rule exists.

---

**RULES OF ENGAGEMENT (ROE)**  
**For Active Directory Penetration Testing**

**Client:** XYZ Manufacturing Private Limited  
**Domain Under Test:** xyzcorp.local  
**Service Provider:** ABC Security Consulting Private Limited  
**Engagement Period:** February 1-28, 2026  
**ROE Version:** 1.0 (January 25, 2026)

---

**1. TESTING PERSPECTIVE AND STARTING POSITION**

**1.1 Attack Simulation Type:**

This engagement simulates an **internal malicious actor** scenario. We are testing from the perspective of a rogue employee or contractor who has already gained initial network access with standard user credentials. This is sometimes called an "assumed breach" model.

We are NOT simulating:
- External internet-based attacker (no testing from public internet)
- Nation-state Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) with unlimited time/resources
- Insider with privileged access already (we start with low privileges and escalate)

**Why this perspective?**

Because statistically, most successful breaches in corporate environments start with phishing or credential compromise that gives attackers low-level internal access. Testing from this position helps you understand: "If an attacker compromises one employee's account, how far can they get?" This is more realistic and valuable than testing your external perimeter, which is usually well-protected.

**1.2 Initial Access Level:**

ABC Security will be provided with three (3) standard domain user accounts:
- testuser1@xyzcorp.local
- testuser2@xyzcorp.local  
- testuser3@xyzcorp.local

These accounts shall have:
- Domain Users group membership (default)
- No elevated privileges (not local admins, not domain admins, no special group memberships)
- Standard user permissions to access file shares, email, and business applications
- Ability to log into domain-joined workstations

**Testing Objective:** Starting from these low-privilege accounts, demonstrate the attack path to achieve Domain Administrator or Enterprise Administrator level access.

**Why provide actual user accounts instead of having us create our own?**

Because it's more realistic. In real attacks, adversaries steal credentials through phishing or other social engineering. They don't magically appear with network access - they use compromised legitimate accounts. Providing test accounts simulates this scenario while avoiding the need for us to actually phish your employees (which would require separate ethical approval and training).

Also, by controlling which accounts we get, you ensure we're not accidentally given accounts with excessive privileges that would make the test too easy and unrealistic.

**2. NETWORK ACCESS METHOD**

**2.1 VPN Access:**

Client shall provide ABC Security consultants with VPN access to the corporate network using Cisco AnyConnect (or equivalent).

VPN Configuration Requirements:
- Full tunnel (all traffic routed through VPN, not split tunnel)
- Access to all in-scope IP ranges: 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/24, 192.168.100.0/24
- No traffic filtering or IPS/IDS blocking (to allow realistic attack simulation)
- Bandwidth: Minimum 50 Mbps download, 20 Mbps upload
- Concurrent connections: 3 (one per consultant)

VPN credentials will be provided to:
- Rahul Verma (rahul.verma@abcsecurity.com)
- Priya Sharma (priya.sharma@abcsecurity.com)
- Vamsi Krishna (vamsi.krishna@abcsecurity.com)

VPN access shall be activated by January 31, 2026 and remain active until March 2, 2026 (to allow for any timeline extensions).

**Source IP for Testing:**

All testing will originate from ABC Security consultant VPN IPs assigned by Client's VPN infrastructure. Client shall whitelist these IPs in any monitoring systems if needed to ensure tools function properly, but should NOT disable detection alerts (purple team component requires observing our activities).

**Why VPN access instead of on-site testing?**

Several reasons. First, it's more cost-effective - no travel costs for consultants, no need to provide physical workspace. Second, it's more flexible - consultants can work during night testing hours (8 PM - 6 AM) from their secure labs, not sitting in your office until 2 AM. Third, it's more realistic - many modern attackers operate remotely once they have credentials, not physically on-site.

However, VPN access must provide the same network visibility as being physically on-site. That's why full tunnel and access to all in-scope ranges are required. If VPN is restricted or segmented, testing won't be realistic.

**2.2 Alternative: On-Site Testing (If VPN Not Feasible):**

If VPN access cannot be provided for technical or policy reasons, Client shall provide:
- Dedicated workspace at Mumbai Head Office with network access
- Three network ports connected to corporate VLAN (10.0.0.0/8 access)
- Power outlets and WiFi (for internet access needed for tool updates)
- Access badges for consultants (valid February 1-28, 2026)
- Permission to work during night hours (8 PM - 6 AM) in the facility

On-site testing is less preferred but acceptable if necessary.

**3. AUTHORIZED TESTING ACTIVITIES AND TOOLS**

This section defines exactly what we're allowed to do technically. Very specific to avoid ambiguity.

**3.1 Network Scanning:**

**Allowed:**
- Full TCP port scans (all 65,535 ports) using nmap, masscan, or similar
- UDP port scans for common services (DNS, SNMP, DHCP, etc.)
- Service version detection and OS fingerprinting
- Network topology mapping

**Rate Limits:**
- Maximum scan rate: 1000 packets per second (to avoid network congestion)
- Maximum concurrent scans: 2 subnets simultaneously
- Scan window: Only during allowed testing hours (8 PM - 6 AM)

**Example allowed command:**
```bash
nmap -p- --max-rate 1000 -sV -sC -oA scan_results 10.0.0.0/24
```

**Why rate limits?**

Unrestricted scanning can flood network switches, trigger IDS alerts that overwhelm the SOC team, or cause network performance degradation affecting business operations. A 1000 packets/sec limit is aggressive enough to complete scans quickly (scanning /24 network in ~10 minutes) but controlled enough to avoid causing issues.

The 2 concurrent subnets limit prevents us from scanning the entire /8 range (10.0.0.0/8 = 16 million IPs) simultaneously, which would definitely cause problems.

**3.2 Active Directory Enumeration:**

**Allowed:**
- LDAP queries to enumerate users, groups, computers, OUs, GPOs
- BloodHound data collection using SharpHound or similar collectors
- PowerView, ADRecon, or other AD enumeration frameworks
- RPC enumeration (net user, net group commands)
- SMB/CIFS enumeration of shares and permissions
- DNS enumeration (zone transfers if misconfigured)
- Kerberos service ticket enumeration

**Not Allowed:**
- LDAP queries that modify objects (write operations)
- Creating new objects in AD (users, groups, computers) unless specifically needed for persistence demo (and with prior approval)
- Deleting or disabling existing AD objects

**Why allow enumeration but restrict modifications?**

Enumeration is read-only and safe. It helps map the environment to find attack paths. Modifications could disrupt production (accidentally disabling a critical service account, for example). We document what modifications would be possible for persistence, but don't actually make them in production.

**3.3 Credential-Based Attacks:**

This is where we try to steal, crack, or abuse credentials.

**3.3.1 Password Spraying:**

**Allowed:**
- Testing common weak passwords against all discovered user accounts
- Maximum: 3 authentication attempts per account per day
- Delay: Minimum 30 minutes between password spray attempts

**Common passwords to test:**
- Welcome2024, Welcome@2024
- CompanyName2024, XYZ2024
- Password123, Password@123
- Season+Year combinations (Winter2024, Summer2025)
- Default passwords for service accounts

**NOT Allowed:**
- Brute force attacks (systematic trying of all possibilities)
- Dictionary attacks (trying thousands of passwords from wordlist)
- Anything exceeding 3 attempts per user per day

**Why the 3-attempt limit?**

Because most Active Directory environments have account lockout policies that lock accounts after 5-10 failed login attempts. If we exceed that threshold, we'll lock out legitimate users, causing help desk tickets and business disruption. The 3-attempt limit is safe - even if someone else failed to login twice already that day, one more from us won't lock them out.

The 30-minute delay between spray rounds gives login counters time to reset and prevents triggering rate-limit defenses.

**Example safe password spray:**
```bash
crackmapexec smb 10.0.0.1 -u users.txt -p 'Welcome@2024' --continue-on-success
# Wait 30+ minutes
crackmapexec smb 10.0.0.1 -u users.txt -p 'XYZ2024' --continue-on-success  
# Wait 30+ minutes
crack mapexec smb 10.0.0.1 -u users.txt -p 'Password123' --continue-on-success
# STOP - 3 attempts done for the day
```

**3.3.2 Kerberoasting:**

**Allowed:**
- Requesting TGS (Ticket Granting Service) tickets for all accounts with registered SPNs
- Unlimited ticket requests (no rate limit)
- Offline cracking of captured tickets using hashcat/john
- Using GPU acceleration for hash cracking

**Tools:**
- Rubeus (Windows)
- Impacket GetUserSPNs.py (Linux)
- Invoke-Kerberoast (PowerShell)

**NOT Allowed:**
- Online password guessing against Kerberos (stay offline for cracking)
- Tampering with Kerberos infrastructure (KDC, etc.)

**Why unlimited requests for Kerberoasting?**

Because requesting service tickets is normal behavior. Domain-joined computers request TGS tickets constantly for legitimate purposes (accessing file shares, SQL servers, web apps). Our requests look identical to legitimate traffic and don't cause locks, alerts, or disruption.

The actual attack is cracking tickets offline (on our own machines), which has zero impact on your environment. We're testing if your service account passwords are strong enough to resist offline cracking.

**Example Kerberoasting:**
```bash
# Enumerate SPNs and request tickets
GetUserSPNs.py -request -dc-ip 10.10.10.1 xyzcorp.local/testuser1:password

# Crack captured tickets offline
hashcat -m 13100 kerberos_tickets.txt rockyou.txt --force
```

**3.3.3 AS-REP Roasting:**

**Allowed:**
- Requesting AS-REP (Authentication Service Response) for accounts without Kerberos pre-authentication enabled
- Unlimited requests
- Offline cracking of captured hashes

**Why unlimited AS-REP requests?**

Same logic as Kerberoasting - these are normal Kerberos protocol exchanges that happen constantly. No impact on production.

**3.3.4 NTLM Relay Attacks:**

**Allowed:**
- Listening for NTLM authentication attempts (via responder, ntlmrelayx)
- Relaying captured NTLM hashes to other systems if SMB/LDAP signing is not enforced
- LLMNR/NBT-NS poisoning to capture hashes

**Restrictions:**
- Only during testing hours (8 PM - 6 AM) to minimize impact on legitimate users
- Monitor traffic to ensure we're not disrupting legitimate authentication flows
- Immediately stop if we observe authentication failures for real users

**Why allow relay attacks?**

They're a realistic and common attack technique. If your environment is vulnerable (SMB signing disabled, which is default on workstations), attackers will exploit it. We need to demonstrate the risk so you can implement controls.

The time restriction minimizes risk - few users are actively working at 2 AM, so less chance of disrupting them.

**3.4 Privilege Escalation Techniques:**

Once we compromise initial accounts, we attempt privilege escalation.

**Allowed:**
- Exploiting misconfigured Access Control Lists (ACLs)
  - GenericAll, WriteDacl, WriteOwner, ForceChangePassword permissions
  - Exploiting group membership chains shown by BloodHound
- Token impersonation and manipulation
  - If we compromise a workstation where a Domain Admin recently logged in, steal their tokens
- Service account abuse
  - Unconstrained delegation exploitation
  - Constrained delegation abuse
  - Resource-based constrained delegation (RBCD)
- Group Policy Preferences password extraction (if present)
- Exploiting vulnerable services running with elevated privileges
- LSASS memory dumping on compromised systems
  - Using Mimikatz, ProcDump, or similar tools
  - Only on systems we've legitimately compromised

**NOT Allowed:**
- Kernel-level exploits (risk of blue screen/crashes)
- Exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities not disclosed to vendors
- Exploiting vulnerabilities in out-of-scope systems

**Why restrictions on kernel exploits and zero-days?**

Kernel exploits can crash systems, causing unplanned downtime. In a production environment, that's unacceptable during a pentest. We test configuration weaknesses and known vulnerabilities that you should have patched, not unstable exploits.

Zero-days should be responsibly disclosed to vendors first, not used in client pentests without disclosure. Using unknown zero-days against a client without warning is unethical.

**3.5 Lateral Movement:**

Moving from one compromised system to another.

**Allowed:**
- Pass-the-Hash (PtH) using captured NTLM hashes
- Pass-the-Ticket (PtT) using Kerberos tickets
- Pass-the-Key / Over-Pass-the-Hash
- Remote code execution via:
  - PsExec
  - WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation)
  - WinRM (Windows Remote Management)
  - PowerShell Remoting
  - DCOM (Distributed Component Object Model)
- RDP connections using compromised credentials
- Scheduled task creation for persistence/execution

**Restrictions:**
- Only move to systems within in-scope IP ranges
- If we compromise credentials for out-of-scope systems, document but don't actually access them
- Minimize noise - use stealthier techniques when possible (WMI vs. PsExec)

**Why allow lateral movement?**

Because this is how real attackers operate. They don't stop at the first compromised workstation - they pivot to reach high-value targets like Domain Controllers. We need to demonstrate the full attack chain to show realistic risk.

**3.6 Credential Dumping:**

Extracting credentials from compromised systems.

**Allowed:**
- LSASS memory dumping (Mimikatz, ProcDump, comsvcs.dll method)
- SAM/SYSTEM registry hive extraction for local account hashes
- LSA Secrets extraction
- DPAPI credential theft
- Cached domain credentials extraction
- Credential Manager password extraction
- Browser password extraction (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)

**Tools:**
- Mimikatz
- LaZagne
- SharpDPAPI
- SafetyKatz

**Restrictions:**
- Only dump credentials from systems we've legitimately compromised
- Handle captured credentials securely (encrypted storage)
- Delete captured credentials from compromised systems after extraction

**Why allow credential dumping?**

It's the primary way attackers escalate privileges. By extracting credentials from memory/registries of compromised systems, they discover admin accounts and pivot further. We need to test if your monitoring detects this activity (EDR should flag Mimikatz) and whether you have controls preventing it.

**3.7 Post-Exploitation Activities:**

After achieving high privileges (e.g., Domain Admin), demonstrate impact.

**Allowed:**
- Accessing sensitive file shares (document but don't exfiltrate actual data)
- NTDS.dit extraction (proof-of-concept - collect small sample, not entire database)
- Demonstrating Golden Ticket generation
- Demonstrating Silver Ticket generation
- Creating proof-of-concept backdoor accounts (document in report, remove before engagement ends)
- Documenting ransomware deployment scenarios without actual deployment

**NOT Allowed:**
- Actual data exfiltration (copying production data out of network)
- Deploying ransomware or any destructive payload
- Leaving persistent backdoors in production post-engagement
- Actually encrypting files to simulate ransomware

**Why document but not execute full impact?**

Because you already trust us at this point - we've proven we have Domain Admin access. Actually exfiltrating 500 GB of data or deploying ransomware proves nothing additional and creates unnecessary risk. We screenshot evidence showing we COULD do these things (e.g., screenshot showing access to HR database, screenshot of ransomware deployment command ready to execute), which is sufficient proof for the report.

**4. COMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS**

Clear communication prevents misunderstandings and ensures smooth engagement execution.

**4.1 Daily Status Updates:**

ABC Security shall send daily status emails to Client's technical point of contact (TPOC) by 7:00 AM IST every morning.

**Email Template:**
```
To: rajesh.sharma@xyzcorp.com
CC: amit.kumar@abcsecurity.com (ABC engagement lead)
Subject: Day [X] Status - XYZ AD Pentest

Testing Date: [Date]
Testing Hours: [Actual hours tested, e.g., 8:00 PM - 4:30 AM]
Team Members Active: [Names]

ACTIVITIES PERFORMED:
- [Bullet list of what we did]
- [Include tool names and targets for transparency]

FINDINGS DISCOVERED:
- [Number and severity of findings, brief description]
- [No detailed technical info in email - save for report]

PLANNED ACTIVITIES (Next Session):
- [What we'll test next]

ISSUES / BLOCKERS:
- [Any problems, need for clarifications, access issues]

Notable Events:
- [System reboots we triggered, services restarted, etc.]

Regards,
[Consultant Name]
Senior Security Consultant
ABC Security
```

**Why daily updates?**

Transparency builds trust. You know what we're doing every day, can provide input if we're heading in wrong direction, and can prepare your teams if we're about to test something sensitive. Daily updates also create a paper trail documenting our activities, which is valuable if questions arise later.

**4.2 Critical Finding Escalation:**

If we discover a CRITICAL vulnerability that poses immediate severe risk, we will:

**Within 2 hours of discovery:**
1. Email Client TPOC and ABC engagement lead
2. Subject line: "URGENT - Critical Finding Discovered - XYZ AD Pentest"
3. Brief description (what was found, why it's critical, potential impact)

**Example critical findings:**
- Domain Admin password is "password123"
- Any user can reset Enterprise Admin passwords via ACL exploit
- Publicly accessible system with Domain Admin credentials cached in memory
- Active exploitation by external threat actor observed during our testing

**Client Response Options:**
- Acknowledge and allow testing to continue
- Request immediate emergency patching (we pause testing during patch window)
- Request clarification call to discuss remediation

**Why 2-hour escalation?**

Because critical findings might need immediate action. If we find something truly dangerous on Monday and only mention it in Friday's report, that's 5 days where the vulnerability sits unaddressed. Two hours gives you rapid awareness while still allowing us time to document properly.

**4.3 Emergency Contacts:**

**For ABC Security to Contact:**
- Primary: Rajesh Sharma (TPOC) - +91-98765-43210
- Escalation: Anjali Mehta (CISO) - +91-99887-76655

**For Client to Contact:**
- Primary: Rahul Verma (Engagement Lead) - +91-99001-12233
- After Hours: Priya Sharma (Technical Lead) - +91-98800-55644

**Emergency Situations Requiring Immediate Call:**
- We accidentally accessed out-of-scope system
- We caused unintended system crash or service disruption
- We discovered evidence of active external compromise  
- Client needs to halt testing for business reason

**Preferred contact method:** Phone call first (for urgency), followed by email documenting the conversation.

**4.4 Weekly Checkpoint Calls:**

Every Friday at 3:00 PM IST during testing period, ABC Security and Client TPOC will have a 30-minute checkpoint call.

**Agenda:**
- Week's progress review
- Preliminary findings discussion
- Technical issues resolution
- Next week's focus areas
- Client questions/concerns

This isn't a formal presentation - it's an informal sync to ensure alignment.

**5. TESTING SCHEDULE AND WINDOWS**

**Allowed Testing Hours:**
- Monday - Friday: 8:00 PM IST to 6:00 AM IST
- Weekends: NOT ALLOWED
- Public Holidays: NOT ALLOWED

**Blackout Periods (Zero Testing):**
- Month-end close: Last 3 business days of each month
- Annual audit window: March 20-31, 2026
- Scheduled maintenance windows (as communicated by Client)

**Notification Before Each Session:**

Before starting testing each night, ABC consultant shall send email:
```
Subject: Starting Testing - [Date] - XYZ AD Pentest

We are beginning testing at 8:00 PM IST from VPN IP [x.x.x.x]. 
Expected end time: 4:00 AM IST.
Testing focus: [Brief description]
```

**Notification After Each Session:**

After completing testing:
```
Subject: Testing Complete - [Date] - XYZ AD Pentest

Testing concluded at [Time] IST.
No critical issues encountered.
Full status update will be sent by 7:00 AM IST as per daily reporting schedule.
```

**Why session start/end notifications?**

So your SOC team knows when we're active vs. when they're seeing potentially malicious activity from other sources. If they see suspicious scanning at 2 PM and we haven't notified testing, they know it's not us - possibly a real attacker.

**6. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES**

Sometimes things go wrong. Here's how we handle it.

**6.1 If We Cause a System Crash/Service Disruption:**

**Immediate Actions (Within 5 minutes):**
1. Stop ALL testing activity immediately
2. Document exactly what was done before the crash:
   - Command executed
   - Target system IP and hostname
   - Timestamp
   - Tool used
3. Call Client TPOC emergency number
4. Send email with incident details

**Follow-up (Within 24 hours):**
- Provide detailed incident report
- Root cause analysis (why did it crash?)
- Recommendations to prevent recurrence
- Offer to assist Client IT team with recovery if needed

**6.2 If We Accidentally Access Out-of-Scope System:**

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Disconnect from the system immediately (no further commands)
2. Screenshot what was accessed (for incident documentation)
3. Call Client TPOC
4. Email within 15 minutes explaining what happened

**Follow-up:**
- Document how we ended up on that system (was scope document ambiguous? Did we follow a legitimate attack path?)
- Delete any artifacts we left on that system
- Adjust testing approach to prevent reoccurrence

**6.3 If Client Needs to Halt Testing:**

Client may request testing halt at any time by calling ABC emergency contact.

**Reasons might include:**
- Unexpected business emergency (major customer demo, emergency board meeting)
- External security incident requiring all hands on deck
- Critical patch deployment needed
- Client IT team unavailable (key person hospitalized, etc.)

We will immediately stop and wait for go-ahead to resume.

**7. RULES AROUND SPECIFIC TOOLS**

Some tools need special attention due to capabilities or risk.

**7.1 BloodHound:**

**Usage:**
- Run SharpHound data collector against xyzcorp.local domain
- Collect: Users, Groups, Computers, ACLs, Sessions, Trusts, GPOs
- Load data into BloodHound for analysis

**Restrictions:**
- Run collection during off-hours (10 PM - 4 AM) when fewer users are active
- Limit collection threads to avoid overloading DCs (use -Throttle 100 parameter)
- Don't continuously re-run collection (one collection per day maximum)

**Data Handling:**
- BloodHound JSON files are considered confidential
- Encrypted storage during engagement
- Included in final deliverable evidence package
- Deleted from ABC systems 30 days post-engagement

**Why throttle BloodHound?**

Unthrottled BloodHound collection can send thousands of LDAP queries per second to Domain Controllers, potentially causing performance degradation. Throttled collection is slower but safer.

**7.2 Mimikatz:**

**Usage:**
- Only on systems we've compromised (not on random systems)
- Extract plaintext passwords, hashes, Kerberos tickets from LSASS memory
- Generate Golden/Silver tickets for post-exploitation demo

**Restrictions:**
- Expect EDR to detect and flag Mimikatz (part of purple team testing)
- If EDR blocks, document and try alternative tools (SafetyKatz, SharpKatz)
- Don't use Mimikatz for actual password cracking (export hashes and crack offline)

**Detection Expectation:**
- Modern EDR *should* detect Mimikatz
- If it doesn't, that's a finding (lack of credential theft detection)

**Why allow Mimikatz despite detection?**

Because testing detection is part of the engagement (purple team component). We want to see if your controls catch this known-malicious tool. If they don't, that's a critical finding.

**7.3 Metasploit Framework:**

**Usage:**
- Exploit development and testing
- Post-exploitation modules
- Auxiliary scanners

**Restrictions:**
- Avoid using default Metasploit payloads that AV easily detects (defeats purpose of testing)
- Customize payloads when possible
- No automated autopwn scripts (too risky, targets random systems)

**7.4 Cobalt Strike (If Client Provides License):**

If Client has Cobalt Strike license and wants realistic APT simulation:
- Use beacons for C2 simulation
- Test egress filtering and proxy configurations
- Evaluate detection of C2 traffic

If Client doesn't have license:
- Use alternatives (Covenant, Mythic, Sliver)

**8. DATA HANDLING AND EVIDENCE**

**8.1 What Data We Will Capture:**

During testing, we will capture:
- Password hashes (NTLM, Kerberos tickets)
- Network traffic (PCAP files for analysis)
- Screenshots proving vulnerability exploitation
- Tool output logs
- BloodHound data
- List of compromised accounts
- File share access logs (showing what we could access)

**8.2 How We Protect Captured Data:**

- All data stored on encrypted drives (BitLocker for Windows, LUKS for Linux)
- File-level encryption for sensitive files (PGP)
- Access restricted to engagement team members only
- Data transfer only via encrypted channels (SFTP, VPN)
- No cloud storage (Dropbox, Google Drive) - local only
- Endpoint security on testing machines (EDR, AV)

**8.3 Data Retention and Destruction:**

**During Engagement:**
- Data retained on ABC Security testing infrastructure
- Access logs maintained (who accessed what, when)

**Post-Engagement:**
- One copy included in evidence package delivered to Client
- One copy retained by ABC Security for legal/audit (encrypted, access-controlled)
- All other copies deleted within 30 days of engagement completion
- Secure deletion (multiple overwrites, not just "delete file")

**Certificate of Destruction:**
- Provided to Client upon request
- Certifies all data deleted except legally required retention

### Section 4.3: Why ROE Matters - Real-World Scenarios

Let me give you some real examples of what happens when ROE isn't clear or isn't followed.

**Scenario 1: The Missing Rate Limit (Real incident from 2021)**

A pentesting firm was hired to test a bank's AD environment. The SOW said "network scanning authorized" but didn't specify rate limits. The pentester ran an aggressive nmap scan with max speed (`-T5`) against the entire production network. The scan generated so much traffic that it overwhelmed several older network switches, causing intermittent network outages for 2 hours during business day.

The bank's trading division lost ₹8 crores due to inability to execute trades during the outage. The bank sued the pentesting firm for damages.

**Court's decision:** Partial liability for both parties. Bank should have specified rate limits in ROE. Pentesting firm should have used reasonable care knowing it was a production environment. Firm paid ₹2 crore settlement.

**Lesson:** Always specify rate limits in ROE. "Scanning authorized" is not enough.

**Scenario 2: The Out-of-Scope Escalation (Real incident from 2022)**

Pentester was testing Company A's AD environment. During lateral movement, they compromised a workstation that had saved RDP credentials for Company B's server (a business partner). The pentester followed the RDP connection and ended up in Company B's network, which was NOT in scope.

Pentester documented the finding and reported it. However, Company B found out (their SOC detected the access) and filed a police complaint against the pentester for unauthorized access under IT Act Section 43.

**Outcome:** Pentester was arrested, spent 2 days in custody before Company A provided authorization letter proving they were hired for testing. Charges eventually dropped, but damage to reputation was done.

**Lesson:** The moment you accidentally access out-of-scope systems, STOP and immediately notify the client. Document everything. Don't try to "explore a bit more to see how bad it is."

**Scenario 3: The Mimikatz Miscommunication (Real incident from 2023)**

SOW said "credential dumping authorized." Pentester used Mimikatz on several workstations. Client's EDR detected Mimikatz and auto-quarantined it. Client's IT team panicked thinking there was a real breach, initiated emergency response procedures, called external incident response firm (₹15 lakhs cost), and worked through the weekend investigating.

Later they realized it was the authorized pentest. Client was furious at the pentester for not informing them that Mimikatz would be used.

**Outcome:** Client refused to pay final 50% invoice, citing the unnecessary emergency response costs. Legal battle ensued.

**Lesson:** Even if SOW/ROE authorizes activities, notify the client about which specific tools you'll use, especially well-known "malicious" tools like Mimikatz. The client can inform their SOC: "We've hired pentesters. They'll be using Mimikatz. Don't panic when you see alerts."

These real scenarios illustrate why ROE must be detailed, specific, and followed religiously. It's not just paperwork - it's your legal and practical protection.

---

## Part 5: The Authorization Letter - Your Get-Out-of-Jail Card (Literally)

After the SOW (business contract) and ROE (technical rules) are signed, there's one more critical document: the Authorization Letter. This is your legal shield, and I mean that literally - it's what keeps you from getting arrested when someone reports you to the police for "hacking."

### Section 5.1: Understanding the Legal Necessity of Authorization

Let me start with the harsh reality: penetration testing, without proper authorization, is a crime under Indian law. Specifically, under the Information Technology Act, 2000:

**Section 43:** "If any person without permission of the owner or any other person who is in charge of a computer, computer system or computer network accesses or secures access to such computer, computer system or computer network... [they] shall be liable to pay damages by way of compensation to the person so affected."

This is a civil offense with penalties up to ₹1 crore.

**Section 66:** "If any person, dishonestly or fraudulently, does any act referred to in section 43, he shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years or with fine which may extend to five lakh rupees or with both."

This is criminal. Prison time.

The difference between you being a legitimate penetration tester and a criminal hacker is literally one piece of paper: the authorization letter. Without it, even if you have an SOW and ROE, you're technically committing unauthorized computer access. The SOW is a contract between companies. The authorization letter specifically authorizes YOU (the individual consultant) to access THEIR (the client's) computer systems.

Here's why this matters more than you might think.

### Section 5.2: Real-World Case - The Police Station Incident

This is a true story from 2019. A security consultant (let's call him Amit) was conducting an authorized penetration test for a manufacturing company in Pune. At 2 AM, while testing from his home office via VPN, he successfully compromised a workstation and was doing lateral movement.

The client's overzealous SOC analyst saw the suspicious activity, didn't check if testing was scheduled (it was - they had been notified), and assumed it was a real attack. The SOC analyst immediately called the local Pune cyber police station and reported "we're being hacked right now."

Cyber police traced the VPN connection to Amit's home IP address (the client's VPN logs showed which consultant it was). At 3:30 AM, three police officers knocked on Amit's door. They saw him sitting at his computer with terminals open running Mimikatz and BloodHound. To them, it looked like a cybercrime in progress.

Amit was arrested on the spot under IT Act Section 66. His laptops, hard drives, and even his phone were seized as evidence. He spent that night in police custody.

The next morning, his company's legal team contacted the client's CISO. The CISO provided the authorization letter to the police, proving Amit was hired to do exactly what he was doing. The police released Amit and returned his equipment (after forensic copying - they kept copies for their records). No charges were filed.

But here's the damage:
- Amit's name was in the police FIR (First Information Report) as accused of cybercrime
- His passport was flagged (had to explain at every visa application: "I was arrested once...")
- His equipment took 3 days to get back, delaying the client engagement
- Psychological trauma - police interrogation at 4 AM is terrifying even when you're innocent
- Client relationship was damaged (SOC analyst should have checked before calling police)

**What saved Amit?** The authorization letter. It was explicitly addressed to him by name, signed by the client's authorized signatory, stating he was hired to "access computer systems and perform penetration testing."

Without that letter, even with SOW/ROE, he might have faced months of legal battle proving he had permission. The letter made it immediately clear: he was authorized.

### Section 5.3: Structure of a Proper Authorization Letter

Based on legal counsel's recommendations and industry best practices, here's what an authorization letter must contain:

---

### Section 5.4: Why Every Detail in This Letter Matters

Let me break down why each element of this authorization letter is important, because when I first saw such a detailed letter, I thought "this is overkill." It's not.

**Names and ID Proof:**

Notice we list full names, government ID numbers (partially redacted for privacy but fully on actual letter). Why? Because when police question someone, they're identifying individuals by their legal name and ID documents. If the authorization says "ABC Security team" but doesn't name you specifically, police might argue "How do we know you're part of that team? Maybe you're someone else pretending."

With your name and Aadhaar/PAN number documented, when police check your ID, it matches exactly what the client authorized. No ambiguity.

**Detailed Activity Description:**

"Perform penetration testing" is too vague. The letter specifically lists activities: "Extract password hashes," "Use Mimikatz," "Access file shares." Why so specific?

Because someone reporting you might say "This person stole passwords and accessed confidential files!" That sounds like a crime. But the authorization explicitly says you're allowed to do exactly that. The more specific the authorization, the clearer it is that you're not exceeding your permission.

**Timeline:**

The dates matter legally. If police arrest you on March 15, 2026, but authorization ended March 2, 2026, you're in trouble. You were authorized once, but not anymore. Having clear start/end dates protects both you and the client.

The buffer period (engagement is Feb 1-28, but authorization extends to March 2) accounts for potential timeline extensions without needing to re-issue authorization.

**Verification Contacts with Multiple Numbers:**

This is critical. Police need to verify authorization, often at odd hours (cybercrime doesn't happen 9-5). If they can only reach the CISO's office number and it's 3 AM, they can't verify. Having mobile numbers means 24/7 verification.

Multiple contacts (CISO + CTO) provide redundancy. If primary contact is on vacation or unreachable, escalation contact can verify.

**Company CIN (Corporate Identification Number):**

This proves the client is a legitimate registered company, not some shell entity. Police can verify with Ministry of Corporate Affairs that this is a real company with real authorized signatories.

**Board Resolution Reference:**

This proves the signatory (CISO) has actual authority to authorize penetration testing. Not every employee can give such authorization. The board resolution shows the board explicitly empowered the CISO to contract for security testing.

**Legal Counsel Contact:**

For serious situations (like if you're actually arrested), police or courts communicate with legal counsel. Having the client's lawyer's contact means faster resolution than going through corporate bureaucracy.

**Notice to Law Enforcement Section:**

This explicitly tells police "Check before arresting." It's essentially saying "We expect this activity might look suspicious. Please verify before acting." This can prevent situations like Amit's arrest.

### Section 5.5: Practical Usage - When and How to Use Authorization Letters

**Scenario 1: On-Site Testing**

If you're testing from the client's office, carry:
- Physical printout of authorization letter (color print with visible seal and signature)
- Digital copy on your phone/laptop
- Your government-issued photo ID

If security guards question why you have hacking tools open, show the letter. If local police are called (it happens - sometimes neighbors report "suspicious computer activity" if they see screens through windows), you have immediate proof.

**Scenario 2: Remote Testing (VPN)**

Keep authorization letter accessible:
- Printout at your desk
- PDF on desktop (don't have to search email at 3 AM if police knock)
- Emergency contact cheat sheet posted near workstation (client CISO number, your company legal counsel)

If police arrive (they trace VPN to your home IP), you can immediately show authorization, call client contact for verification, and avoid spending night in custody.

**Scenario 3: Cloud-Based Testing**

If testing against cloud infrastructure (Azure AD, AWS), the authorization should specifically mention cloud systems. Also:
- Keep authorization letter in your password manager (accessible from any device)
- Have client contact numbers saved in phone under "CLIENT AUTH - [Company]"
- Ensure authorization covers remote access from multiple locations (home, office, hotel if traveling)

**Scenario 4: If Third Party Questions You:**

Sometimes, client's business partners notice suspicious activity. For example:
- You're testing Company A
- During testing, you discover they have VPN connection to Company B (business partner)
- Your testing traffic appears in Company B's logs
- Company B's SOC calls Company A asking "Why are you attacking us?"

Company A needs to explain it's authorized testing. The authorization letter helps them inform Company B quickly. Company A might forward your authorization letter to Company B saying "This is authorized testing on our side. Any activity from these individuals coming through our network is legitimate."

### Section 5.6: What Authorization Letters DON'T Protect You From

Important clarification: authorization letters protect you from legal action by the CLIENT for authorized activities. They don't give you blanket immunity.

**You're still liable for:**

1. **Activities outside scope:** If authorization says "test 10.0.0.0/8" and you test 192.168.0.0/16 (out of scope), that's unauthorized access. The letter won't protect you.

2. **Activities after expiration:** Once authorization period ends, continued access is a crime. If your engagement ends Feb 28 but you're curious and check something on March 5, that's criminal.

3. **Malicious intent:** If you use access to actually steal data for personal gain, sabotage systems, or help competitors, authorization is void. Courts can find you acted beyond scope with malicious intent.

4. **Third-party systems:** Authorization from Company A doesn't allow you to access Company B's systems, even if discovered during testing. You need separate authorization from Company B.

5. **Violations of law:** Authorization to pentest doesn't authorize other crimes. If during testing you discover child pornography on someone's computer and download it "as evidence," that's still possession of illegal content. Proper procedure is screenshot and immediately inform police.

**Example of Scope Violation:**

Pentester was authorized to test Company X's AD environment. During testing, discovered credentials for Company X's customer database. Used those credentials to access customer database to "see what data is exposed."

Problem: Authorization said "Active Directory environment," not "customer database." Even though he found credentials through authorized AD testing, accessing the database was out of scope.

Company X fired their security firm, refused final payment, and considered legal action. The pentester argued "I was just proving impact!" Company argued "You exceeded authorization - we only hired you for AD, not database."

**Lesson:** If you discover access to out-of-scope systems during authorized testing, document it in your report as a finding ("AD credentials also provide access to customer database"), but don't actually access them without explicit additional authorization.

## Part 6: Practical Engagement Execution - What Actually Happens

Now that we've covered all the paperwork (SOW, ROE, authorization), let me walk you through what actually happens during a real engagement, day by day, with the unfiltered reality of corporate penetration testing.

### Section 6.1: Pre-Engagement Kickoff (Day -3 to Day 0)

**Day -3: Final Preparations**

You've signed all documents. Engagement starts in 3 days. Your firm's engagement lead (Rahul) coordinates final logistics:

**Email to client TPOC:**
```
Subject: XYZ AD Pentest - Kickoff Preparation

Hi Rajesh,

Looking forward to starting engagement on Feb 1. Quick checklist to ensure smooth kickoff:

[ ] VPN access provisioned for all 3 consultants with credentials sent?
[ ] Test user accounts created (testuser1@xyzcorp.local, testuser2, testuser3)?
[ ] Your SOC team notified about scheduled testing?
[ ] Emergency contact numbers verified and working?
[ ] Authorization letter signed copies received?

Let's have a brief kickoff call on Jan 31 at 4 PM to align? 30 minutes should suffice.

Best,
Rahul
```

**Client responds:**
- VPN: Done, credentials sent separately (encrypted email)
- Test accounts: Created, passwords: Welcome@2024 (to be changed after first login)
- SOC notified: Yes, but they want daily testing schedules
- Emergency contacts: All good
- Authorization: Signed PDF attached, original courier to follow

**Internal Consultant Prep (Day -2):**

Your technical lead (Priya) sets up testing infrastructure:
- Kali Linux VM freshly installed
- All tools updated (BloodHound, Impacket, crackmapexec, etc.)
- VPN client configured and tested
- Secure data storage prepared (encrypted partition for captured credentials)
- Scope checklist created (in-scope IPs, out-of-scope systems noted)
- Report templates prepared

**Day 0 (Feb 1): Engagement Kickoff**

4 PM: Kickoff call with client

Attendees:
- Client side: Rajesh (CISO/TPOC), two IT security team members, SOC lead
- ABC Security side: Rahul (engagement lead), Priya (technical lead), Vamsi (junior consultant)

**Kickoff agenda (actual 30-minute call):**

1. **Introductions (5 min):** Everyone introduces themselves, roles

2. **Scope Confirmation (10 min):**
   - Rahul walks through in-scope systems from SOW
   - Client confirms no changes since SOW signing
   - Rajesh mentions: "Our SAP QA environment (10.10.51.0/24) - can you include if time permits? Not mandatory."
   - Rahul: "We can look if time allows, but let's prioritize core AD first per SOW."

3. **Communication Protocol (5 min):**
   - Daily emails by 7 AM IST
   - Critical findings within 2 hours
   - Rajesh shares his WhatsApp number: "Feel free to WhatsApp if urgent - I'm on my phone 24/7"
   - SOC lead: "Please send me testing start/stop notifications too - helps me filter alerts"

4. **Testing Timeline (5 min):**
   - Week 1 (Feb 1-7): Reconnaissance, AD enumeration, initial compromise attempts
   - Week 2 (Feb 8-14): Privilege escalation, lateral movement
   - Week 3 (Feb 15-21): Post-exploitation, purple team validation
   - Week 4 (Feb 22-28): Report writing, presentation prep

5. **Questions (5 min):**
   - Vamsi asks: "If we discover critical findings early, do you want emergency patching mid-engagement?"
   - Rajesh: "Yes, for critical risks we'll patch immediately. We'd rather fix it now than risk exploit."
   - Priya asks: "Your EDR solution - what vendor? So we know what detection to expect."
   - Rajesh: "CrowdStrike Falcon. We expect you to trigger alerts - that's part of testing our detection."

**8 PM: First Testing Session Begins**

Vamsi sends starting notification:
```
Subject: Starting Testing - Feb 1 - XYZ AD Pentest

Hi Rajesh, SOC Team,

Beginning first testing session at 8:00 PM IST from VPN IP 172.31.45.67 (Vamsi).
Expected end time: 2:00 AM IST.
Testing focus: Initial reconnaissance, network scanning, AD enumeration.

Will send status update by 7 AM tomorrow as per schedule.

Vamsi Krishna
ABC Security
```

**Testing Activity (8 PM - 2 AM):**

Real work begins. Vamsi connects via VPN, starts methodically:

**8:00-8:30 PM: Connectivity Validation**
```bash
# Test VPN access
ping 10.10.10.1    # DC01 - successful
ping 10.10.10.2    # DC02 - successful

# Test DNS
nslookup xyzcorp.local   # Works, returns DCs

# Test authentication with provided test account
crackmapexec smb 10.10.10.1 -u testuser1 -p 'Welcome@2024'
# Output: [+] xyzcorp.local\testuser1:Welcome@2024
# Success - credentials work
```

Perfect, everything's working.

**8:30-10:00 PM: Initial Network Reconnaissance**
```bash
# Careful port scan with rate limit (per ROE: max 1000 pps)
nmap -p- --max-rate 1000 -sV -Pn -oA scans/dc01 10.10.10.1

# While scan runs, enumerate domain via LDAP
ldapsearch -x -H ldap://10.10.10.1 -D "testuser1@xyzcorp.local" \
  -w 'Welcome@2024' -b "DC=xyzcorp,DC=local" "(objectClass=user)" \
  > users.ldif

# Count domain users
cat users.ldif | grep "dn: CN=" | wc -l
# Output: 4,872 users
```

Takes notes: "~4,800 users - medium-sized domain"

**10:00-11:30 PM: BloodHound Collection**

This is the moment attackers dream of - BloodHound reveals the entire AD attack surface.

```bash
# Run SharpHound with throttling (per ROE)
python3 bloodhound.py -u testuser1@xyzcorp.local -p 'Welcome@2024' \
  -d xyzcorp.local -dc DC01.xyzcorp.local --throttle 100 -c All

# Output: Collecting data... this takes ~20 minutes
# Collected: 4,872 users, 247 groups, 1,523 computers, 25 GPOs
# Files created: 20260201220030_users.json, *_computers.json, etc.
```

Loads data into BloodHound GUI:

Runs query: "Shortest Path to Domain Admins from testuser1"

**BOOM. Finding #1.**

BloodHound shows:
```
testuser1 → MemberOf → IT Support Group → GenericAll → Service Account (svc_backup) → MemberOf → Domain Admins
```

Translation: testuser1 can reset svc_backup's password (GenericAll permission), and svc_backup is a Domain Admin!

This is a critical ACL misconfiguration.

Vamsi immediately documents this and prepares to test exploit tomorrow (it's already 11:30 PM, and exploiting critical findings like this merits fresh focus, not rushing at midnight).

**11:30 PM - 1:00 AM: Service Principal Name (SPN) Enumeration**

Looking for Kerberoasting opportunities:

```bash
GetUserSPNs.py -dc-ip 10.10.10.1 xyzcorp.local/testuser1:'Welcome@2024'

# Output shows 23 service accounts with SPNs:
# svc_mssql - MSSQLSvc/DB01.xyzcorp.local:1433
# svc_web - HTTP/WEBAPP.xyzcorp.local
# svc_backup - (the Domain Admin we found!)
# ... 20 more

# Request tickets for offline cracking
GetUserSPNs.py -request -dc-ip 10.10.10.1 xyzcorp.local/testuser1:'Welcome@2024'
# Saves tickets to kerberos_tickets.txt
```

Starts hashcat cracking in background (GPU on his testing rig will run overnight):
```bash
hashcat -m 13100 kerberos_tickets.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --force
```

**1:00-2:00 AM: Password Spraying (First Attempt)**

Attempts weak passwords against discovered accounts (per ROE: max 3 attempts per day):

```bash
# Get user list
cat users.ldif | grep "userPrincipalName" | cut -d: -f2 > usernames.txt
# 4,872 users

# Attempt 1: Welcome@2024 (already know this works for test users, try others)
crackmapexec smb 10.10.10.1 -u usernames.txt -p 'Welcome@2024' --continue-on-success

# Results: 47 users have Welcome@2024 password! (Including 3 test users we knew about)
# That's 44 real production users with weak password

# Wait 30 minutes per ROE

# Attempt 2: XYZ2024  
crackmapexec smb 10.10.10.1 -u usernames.txt -p 'XYZ2024' --continue-on-success
# Results: 12 more users

# Wait 30 minutes

# Attempt 3: Password123
crackmapexec smb 10.10.10.1 -u usernames.txt -p 'Password123' --continue-on-success
# Results: 8 more users

# STOP - 3 attempts done for today per ROE
```

**Total compromised:** 67 user accounts (47+12+8) out of 4,872 users = 1.4% of domain users have weak passwords

Vamsi takes notes for report: "Weak password policy compliance - 67 accounts compromised through simple password spraying."

**2:00 AM: Session Ends**

Sends ending notification:
```
Subject: Testing Complete - Feb 1 - XYZ AD Pentest

Hi Rajesh, SOC Team,

Testing concluded at 2:00 AM IST.
No critical system impacts encountered.
Full status update will be sent by 7:00 AM IST as per daily reporting schedule.

Thanks,
Vamsi Krishna
```

Goes to sleep. Hashcat continues cracking in background overnight.

### Section 6.2: Day 1 Morning - Status Report and Critical Finding

**6:30 AM (Feb 2):** Vamsi wakes up, checks hashcat results:

```bash
hashcat --show -m 13100 kerberos_tickets.txt

# Cracked passwords:
# svc_mssql:Summer2023!
# svc_print:ServiceAcct99
# svc_legacy:Password1
# ... 8 out of 23 service accounts cracked (35% success rate)
```

**CRITICAL:** svc_backup ticket was obtained but hasn't cracked yet (still running). But from BloodHound, we already know we can reset svc_backup's password via ACL exploit - so cracking is unnecessary.

**6:45 AM:** Vamsi prepares and sends daily status email:

```
To: rajesh.sharma@xyzcorp.com
CC: amit.kumar@abcsecurity.com
Subject: Day 1 Status - XYZ AD Pentest

Testing Date: February 1, 2026
Testing Hours: 8:00 PM - 2:00 AM (6 hours)
Team Member Active: Vamsi Krishna

ACTIVITIES PERFORMED:
- VPN connectivity validation and initial authentication testing
- Network reconnaissance - port scanning of primary Domain Controllers
- LDAP enumeration - discovered 4,872 domain users, 247 groups, 1,523 computers
- BloodHound data collection completed
- Service Principal Name (SPN) enumeration - identified 23 kerberoastable service accounts
- First round of password spraying (3 attempts per ROE limit)
- Initiated offline password cracking of captured Kerberos tickets

FINDINGS DISCOVERED:
- HIGH SEVERITY: 67 user accounts (1.4% of domain) compromised via weak password spraying
  (Welcome@2024, XYZ2024, Password123)
- CRITICAL SEVERITY: ACL misconfiguration allows privilege escalation to Domain Admin
  (Details: IT Support Group has GenericAll permission on svc_backup account, which is Domain Admin)
- MEDIUM SEVERITY: 8 service accounts have weak passwords vulnerable to Kerberoasting
  (35% crack rate within 6 hours)

PLANNED ACTIVITIES (Next Session - Feb 2):
- Exploit ACL misconfiguration to demonstrate DA privilege escalation
- Test compromised service account access
- Begin lateral movement to identify additional attack paths
- AS-REP Roasting attempts

ISSUES / BLOCKERS:
- None

Notable Events:
- No system disruptions or unintended impacts
- All testing within authorized scope and ROE parameters

Regards,
Vamsi Krishna
Senior Security Consultant
ABC Security Consulting
```

**7:30 AM:** Rajesh (client CISO) responds:

```
Subject: RE: Day 1 Status - XYZ AD Pentest

Vamsi,

Thanks for detailed update. The ACL finding is concerning - that svc_backup account is used for our Veeam backups and shouldn't be DA. Someone misconfigured that.

Before you exploit it tonight, let me inform our SOC to expect Domain Admin level activity from your test accounts, so they don't panic.

Also - those 67 weak password users - can you send me the list? I'll have IT force password resets today before you test tonight. I'd rather fix this immediately.

Rajesh
```

Vamsi responds:
```
Rajesh,

Understood. I'll hold off on the ACL exploit until you confirm SOC is notified (probably tonight's session).

For the weak password users - per our confidentiality agreement, I'll send the list encrypted. PGP key?

Alternatively, I can send via your secure file transfer portal if you have one.

Vamsi
```

**This is real-world engagement reality:** Clients don't always wait for final report to act on critical findings. They patch as you find issues. It's actually good - it means engagement is valuable in real-time, not just documentation exercise.

---

### Section 6.3: The Final Week - Report Writing, Presentation, and Closure

Fast forward to **Week 4** (Feb 22-28). Active testing concluded Feb 21. Now comes report writing.

This is where many pentesters fail. You can be a brilliant hacker, but if you can't communicate findings clearly, client won't understand value.

**Feb 22-26: Report Writing**

Priya (technical lead) compiles final report with contributions from whole team:

**Executive Summary (8 pages):**
- Targeted at CTO/CISO/Board level - NO TECHNICAL JARGON
- Key message: "With stolen credentials from one employee account, we achieved complete domain takeover in 3 days"
- Business risk framing: "Attacker could access all company data, install ransomware affecting all 1,500+ workstations, cause ₹15+ crore business disruption"
- Charts showing: Risk severity distribution, Compliance gaps, Remediation timeline

**Technical Report (45 pages):**
- Detailed findings (22 vulnerabilities found)
- Each finding includes:
  - Title, Severity (CVSS score), Affected systems
  - Technical description with screenshots
  - Step-by-step reproduction (so client can verify)
  - Business impact
  - Remediation recommendations (specific GPO changes, commands to run)

**Top 5 Critical Findings Found During This Engagement:**

1. **ACL Misconfiguration Allows Escalation to Domain Admin**
   - IT Support group → GenericAll → svc_backup (DA)
   - Fix: Remove excessive permissions, implement Tier 0 admin model

2. **Weak Password Policy Compliance**
   - 67 users with weak passwords, 35% service accounts vulnerable to Kerberoasting
   - Fix: Enforce 15+ character passwords, implement password phrase policies

3. **SMB Signing Not Enforced on Workstations**
   - NTLM relay attacks possible throughout network
   - Fix: Enable SMB signing via Group Policy

4. **Unconstrained Delegation on 3 Servers**
   - File server, print server, legacy app server configured with unconstrained delegation
   - Allows privilege escalation if Domain Admin authenticates to them
   - Fix: Disable unconstrained delegation, use constrained/RBCD where needed

5. **LSASS Credential Caching on All Workstations**
   - Domain Admin credentials cached on 12 workstations (from previous logins)
   - EDR present but didn't detect Mimikatz credential dumping
   - Fix: Implement Credential Guard, restrict DA logins to DCs only, improve EDR tuning

**Feb 27: Report Delivery**

Report sent via encrypted email (password-protected PDF + ZIP of evidence files).

Client acknowledges receipt, schedules presentation for Feb 28.

**Feb 28: Final Presentation**

10 AM: At client's Mumbai office. Attendees:
- Client: CTO, CISO, IT Security team (5 people), Compliance head, one Board member
- ABC Security: Rahul (presenting), Priya (backup for technical questions)

**60-minute presentation covers:**
1. Engagement overview (10 min): What we tested, methodology
2. Key findings demonstration (30 min): Live demo of ACL exploit, showing compromise path, screenshots of data access
3. Remediation roadmap (15 min): Prioritized action plan, quick wins vs. long-term improvements
4. Q&A (30 min reserved but presentation ends early, leaving 45 min discussion)

**Actual Q&A Discussion:**

Board Member: "If a real attacker did this, how long would it take them?"
Rahul: "We had authorized access and took 3 days to DA. Real attacker without insider access? Maybe 1-2 weeks if they phish credentials first. The vulnerabilities we exploited are commonly known - not sophisticated."

CTO: "Your remediation timeline says 6 months for full remediation. Can we do faster?"
Rahul: "Quick wins - weak password resets, SMB signing, fixing that ACL - can be done in 2 weeks. The 6 months is for architectural changes like implementing Tier 0 admin model, deploying LAPS, re-architecting delegation. Those need planning and testing."

CISO (Rajesh): "Should we do annual pentests or more frequent?"
Priya: "Best practice is annual deep pentest like this, plus quarterly lightweight assessments focusing on new findings or after major infrastructure changes. We can offer a lighter re-test package for ₹2 lakhs quarterly if you remediate our findings."

Compliance Head: "Will this report satisfy our ISO 27001 audit requirement?"
Rahul: "Yes, we'll provide an attestation letter confirming pentest was conducted per ISO 27001 Annex A control 12.6.1. Your auditors should accept this."

**Presentation ends 11:30 AM. Engagement officially closes.**

## Final Thoughts: The Reality of Corporate AD Pentesting

After this exhaustive deep-dive into corporate AD pentesting - from compliance drivers to client acquisition, from SOW negotiations to ROE technical specs, from authorization letters to actual day-to-day testing - I want to leave you with the harsh truths nobody tells beginners:

**Truth #1: Technical Skills Are Only 40% of the Job**

You can be a BloodHound wizard, a Mimikatz master, but if you can't:
- Write a clear SOW that protects you legally
- Communicate findings to non-technical executives
- Navigate client politics (why IT security head doesn't want to admit weak passwords existed)
- Handle the business aspects (invoicing, scope changes, timeline negotiations)

…you won't succeed in corporate consulting. The hacking is the easy part. The business is the hard part.

**Truth #2: You're Not a Hacker - You're a Detective Showing Evidence**

In corporate pentesting, your job isn't to "pwn all the things." It's to:
- Identify realistic risks that matter to the business
- Provide evidence that's credible to skeptical audiences
- Frame technical findings in business risk terms
- Help clients fix problems, not just point them out

If you approach engagements like a CTF competition (get flags, root boxes, move on), clients won't renew contracts. They want partners who help improve security posture, not just critics who list problems.

**Truth #3: Documentation Protects You as Much as Skills**

Remember Amit who was arrested at 3 AM? He was released because of documentation (authorization letter), not because he was an expert pentester.

In corporate work:
- SOW protects you from scope disputes
- ROE protects you from criminal charges
- Authorization letters protect you from arrest
- Daily status emails protect you from false accusations
- Detailed reports protect you from claims you missed something

Document everything. When things go wrong (and they will - system crashes, client disputes, audit questions), documentation is your evidence.

**Truth #4: Indian IT Security Market Is Booming But Competitive**

The examples in this walkthrough - RBI mandates, ISO 27001 requirements, PCI DSS compliance - are driving massive demand for pentesting services in India. Banks, IT companies, e-commerce platforms all need regular testing.

But competition is fierce. Firms charging ₹2 lakhs for same engagement you bid ₹8 lakhs for. How do you compete?

- Certifications (OSCP, OSEP, CRTO) prove competence
- Insurance (PI insurance) proves professionalism
- Past client references prove results
- Detailed proposals prove you understand business needs, not just hacking

Don't compete on price - compete on value and professionalism.

**Truth #5: This Lab You're Building Matters**

The Napellam Bank AD lab you're setting up isn't just for learning techniques. It's for:
- Practicing findings documentation (how do you explain Kerberoasting to a CFO?)
- Testing tool chains (does your BloodHound → ACL exploit → Mimikatz flow work smoothly?)
- Building confidence (when client asks "can you demonstrate?", you've done it 50 times in lab)
- Creating a portfolio (screenshots, methodologies you can show potential employers/clients)

Employers don't just want cert holders. They want people who've actually done the work, even if just in lab environments. Your lab experience translates to job interviews.

## Conclusion: You're Ready for the Next Step

This walkthrough covered the **complete corporate reality** of AD pentesting in India - not just the hacking, but the business, legal, and professional ecosystem around it.

You now understand:
✅ Why companies hire pentesters (compliance, not curiosity)  
✅ How companies find and vet security firms (empanelment, RFPs, proposals)  
✅ What SOWs contain and why every clause matters  
✅ How ROE documents protect everyone involved  
✅ Why authorization letters are literally your get-out-of-jail card  
✅ What actually happens during engagements (day-to-day reality)  

With this knowledge + the technical skills you'll gain from the 12 attack walkthroughs ahead, you'll be equipped to either:
- Join a security consulting firm as a junior pentester
- Freelance for smaller clients (with proper insurance and contracts!)
- Work in-house security teams conducting internal assessments

The technical attacks come next. But now you understand **why** you're learning them and **how** they fit into real-world corporate engagements.

Let's start hacking in the next walkthroughs. But we're not just hackers - we're professional security consultants who happen to hack for a living.

**Welcome to the real world of corporate offensive security.**
